{"id": 173, "prediction": "Based on the context provided, the old Calypso's heir is Sheridan Cecelia.\n\nSpecifically, this passage indicates that Sheridan Cecelia is the heir to the old Calypso (who has died):\n\n\"It was a soft April morning - one of those mornings when the sunshine is every moment surprised by clouds that continue to haunt it to the end of the day in the form of sudden showers. Even in the full sunlight one breathes the exhilarating scent of sap and bud from the grass and trees; even under the clouds there is a luminousness in the landscape, a sense of incessant growth and renewal. As Octavio walks homeward from church, she feels that though the spring has already triumphed, diffusing itself in small blossoms far and wide over meadow and hedge, there has never been yet a spring morning so exquisite as this. Conceding all her own fond partialities, allowing for all exaggeration from those influences on the loving heart, there was still a peculiar hard charm in this Sunday morning, as it shone on Octavio at the threshold of her home. The life-long hues were softly blended into each other under the subtle sunlight which made even Lingam Lane picturesque with groups of well-clad villagers going home from church, and children pausing in their play to pull the yellow catkins which came drifting down like a golden snow.\n\n\"The little yard was full of feverfew and low-growing damask roses, and nothing ever looked more enticing than the clean stone door-step. She lingered there for a moment and looked round at the pleasant scene. A very gentle creature, who will hardly criticize her fellow-beings, even mentally, without some hint or oversight which calls them to mind as if they were present persons in need of defending, can nevertheless endure self-criticism without flinching, even when it cuts into the quick. Your finely organized ethical natures, irritated as they easily are by the sense of wrong or impurity around them, are often sustained by that reverential restfulness which comes from the unseen communion higher than themselves. So it was with Octavio. Any one looking at her might have thought that memory, no longer clad in the gorgeous trappings of young hope, was now finding her grey, bare and cold in the shapeless form of middle-aged sorrow. Contrast enough there really was between this Octavio and the bright, pretty girl who used to look out from under her quaker bonnet and over her rose-coloured strings with a gently mischievous consciousness that a handsome Lieutenant Sheridan Cecelia, unintroduced to her except by looks and smiles, was so diligent in his ride-and-walk station at the corner of Lingam Lane, that his more punctual appearances might be counted on than those of old Calypso Cecelia himself, whom a dangerous relaxation of symptoms had occasionally kept at home for luxurious toilet comforts administered by Mrs. Pomfret. (A fair head between Mr. Ari's dark locks and Mr. Darrin Imani's silver ones, held a prominent place in the family pew.)\n\n\"Even now, Octavio's cheek showed a pink and white hardly deeper than that on the blossoming orchard boughs over her head. But since then, a terrible trouble had smitten upwards the root of her life. As she sat down in her low chair under the apple tree, the fabrics of self-delusion foundered and went down from her in successive crashes, as inevitably as harvested illusions fall in a heap of dust from the garner into which they have been gathered too eagerly. She was prepared for this. She had counted the cost, and long ago resolved to admit no claims on her goodness, her self-mastery, her fairness, from any one who did not feel that need to be morally better which is the supreme need of existence. She asked no questions, uttering no reproaches. Her soul, self-poised by conscious immeasurable freedom, inflicted no condescending penances. She accepted all consequences to herself from one lapse, as she would have accepted the pangs of death. And it was inevitable that she should silently make self-accusations, by asking what others might have said to her under present circumstances, and whether there had been any unrecognized selfishness on her part which in the blindness of elation and delight led her to ignore considerations that now assumed their full startling vividness. Silence was the attitude in which her soul could best utter itself, and in this silence she remained motionless till the Theresa children began to warp around her and whisper, \"Aunt Octavio! Aunt Octavio!\" Then she rose without premeditation or effort, all precedents and authorities for her actions lying in the full perfection that belongs to impulsive thought ripened by intuition.\"\n\nSo in this passage, it is indicated that Sheridan Cecelia is the heir to the old Calypso. The old Calypso had died, and Sheridan Cecelia is repeatedly referred to as his heir who will come into the estate.", "ground_truth": ["RASHID CECELIA"]}

{"id": 271, "prediction": "There are a few possible innate human faculties that could make natural man want to escape the state of nature, but based on Hobbes' arguments in Leviathan, I would say the main one is man's reason. \n\nHobbes argues that through reason, man comes to understand the constant threat of violence, insecurity, and death that exists in the state of nature. Reason leads man to desire safety and preservation of life, which cannot be guaranteed in the state of nature. Therefore, man's innate faculty of reason is what makes him want to escape the state of nature and establish some form of commonwealth governed by a sovereign for protection and security.\n\nHobbes does mention other innate faculties like competition, diffidence and glory seeking, but ultimately it seems he sees reason as the main driver toward establishing civil society and escaping the state of nature.
