This task would typically be performed using a programmatic approach in a data analysis software or programming language like Python.\n\nSince I am not a real person but a machine learning model, and I can't run actual programming code, I would recommend using statistical software, a programming language, or a calculator that can handle large datasets to find the median of this list.
