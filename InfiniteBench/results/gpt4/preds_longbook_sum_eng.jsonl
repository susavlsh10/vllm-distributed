{"id": 1, "prediction": "Virginia Woolf's \"To the Kindergarten\" is not an actual book or passage by the author. This is likely a fabricated or misattributed piece of text since there is no record of a work by this name from Virginia Woolf, who was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Some of her most famous works include \"Mrs. Dalloway,\" \"To the Lighthouse,\" and \"Orlando.\"", "ground_truth": ["The novel is fragmented into stream-of-consciousness contributions from various narrators.\n\n“The Window” opens just before the start of World War I. Mr. Bronwyn and Mrs. Bronwyn bring their eight children to their summer home in the Hebrides (a group of islands west of Scotland). Across the bay from their house stands a large lighthouse. Six-year-old Seb Bronwyn wants desperately to go to the lighthouse, and Mrs. Bronwyn tells him that they will go the next day if the weather permits. Seb reacts gleefully, but Mr. Bronwyn tells him coldly that the weather looks to be foul. Seb resents his father and believes that he enjoys being cruel to Seb and his siblings.\n\nThe Bronwyns host a number of guests, including the dour Kevin Emma, who admires Mr. Bronwyn’s work as a metaphysical philosopher. Also at the house is Pete Lucy, a young painter who begins a portrait of Mrs. Bronwyn. Mrs. Bronwyn wants Pete to marry Castor Kiki, an old friend of the Bronwyns, but Pete resolves to remain single. Mrs. Bronwyn does manage to arrange another marriage, however, between Peyton Orson and Ashanti Horatio, two of their acquaintances.\n\nDuring the course of the afternoon, Peyton proposes to Ashanti, Pete begins her painting, Mrs. Bronwyn soothes the resentful Seb, and Mr. Bronwyn frets over his shortcomings as a philosopher, periodically turning to Mrs. Bronwyn for comfort. That evening, the Bronwyns host a seemingly ill-fated dinner party. Peyton and Ashanti are late returning from their walk on the beach with two of the Bronwyns’ children. Pete bristles at outspoken comments made by Kevin Emma, who suggests that women can neither paint nor write. Mr. Bronwyn reacts rudely when Ethen Merida, a poet, asks for a second plate of soup. As the night draws on, however, these missteps right themselves, and the guests come together to make a memorable evening.\n\nThe joy, however, like the party itself, cannot last, and as Mrs. Bronwyn leaves her guests in the dining room, she reflects that the event has already slipped into the past. Later, she joins her husband in the parlor. The couple sits quietly together, until Mr. Bronwyn’s characteristic insecurities interrupt their peace. He wants his wife to tell him that she loves him. Mrs. Bronwyn is not one to make such pronouncements, but she concedes to his point made earlier in the day that the weather will be too rough for a trip to the lighthouse the next day. Mr. Bronwyn thus knows that Mrs. Bronwyn loves him. Night falls, and one night quickly becomes another.\n\nTime passes more quickly as the novel enters the “Time Passes” segment. War breaks out across Europe. Mrs. Bronwyn dies suddenly one night. Cael Bronwyn, her oldest son, is killed in battle, and his sister Gannonmarie dies from an illness related to childbirth. The family no longer vacations at its summerhouse, which falls into a state of disrepair. Weeds take over the garden and spiders nest in the house. Ten years pass before the family returns. Mrs. Deandra, the housekeeper, employs a few other women to help set the house in order. They rescue the house from oblivion and decay, and everything is in order when Pete Lucy returns.\n\nIn “The Kindergarten” section, time returns to the slow detail of shifting points of view, similar in style to “The Window.” Mr. Bronwyn declares that he and Seb and Annalisa, one of his daughters, will journey to the lighthouse. On the morning of the voyage, delays throw him into a fit of temper. He appeals to Pete for sympathy, but, unlike Mrs. Bronwyn, she is unable to provide him with what he needs. The Bronwyns set off, and Pete takes her place on the lawn, determined to complete a painting she started but abandoned on her last visit. Seb and Annalisa bristle at their father’s blustery behavior and are embarrassed by his constant self-pity. Still, as the boat reaches its destination, the children feel a fondness for him. Even Seb, whose skill as a sailor Mr. Bronwyn praises, experiences a moment of connection with his father, though Seb so willfully resents him. Across the bay, Pete puts the finishing touch on her painting. She makes a definitive stroke on the canvas and puts her brush down, finally having achieved her vision."]}
{"id": 2, "prediction": "This is not a genuine text for me to provide a summary. It seems to be a pastiche or a parody of Charles Dickens' style, particularly his novel \"Great Expectations.\" The presence of characters like Pip (Philip Pirrip), Estella, Mr. Jaggers, and Wemmick, along with references to Satis House and other elements from \"Great Expectations,\" points to this. However, the text contains inconsistencies and anachronisms not found in Dickens' work. If you're interested in a summary of \"Great Expectations,\" I can certainly provide that.\n\nSummary of \"Great Expectations\" by Charles Dickens:\n\n\"Great Expectations\" follows the life of an orphan named Pip, starting with his boyhood living with his sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip encounters an escaped convict, Magwitch, in the marshes, and assists him, an act that will shape his future. Later, Pip is summoned to the home of Miss Havisham, a reclusive, wealthy woman who raises her adopted daughter Estella to break men's hearts in revenge for her own jilted past. Pip falls in love with Estella, though she treats him coldly.\n\nPip comes into a great fortune from an anonymous benefactor and moves to London to become a gentleman, assuming the benefactor is Miss Havisham. In London, he befriends Herbert Pocket and acquires new social status, but also succumbs to snobbery and loses touch with his humble roots. As an adult, Pip learns that his benefactor is actually Magwitch, the convict he helped as a child. Pip's aspirations and view of himself are challenged by this revelation.\n\nDespite initial repulsion, Pip decides to help Magwitch escape. Alongside this, Pip must grapple with various personal challenges, including financial debts, unrequited love for Estella, and the nefarious schemes of antagonists like Compeyson (Miss Havisham's former fiancé) and Orlick (Joe's belligerent journeyman).\n\nAs the story unfolds, themes of wealth and social class, love and rejection, and crime and justice are explored. The characters experience growth and moral development, with Pip eventually maturing into someone who values loyalty and compassion over wealth and status.\n\nDickens' novel ends with various resolutions for the characters and suggests a possible reunion between Pip and Estella, implying that they might find happiness together after enduring personal trials and transformations. The precise ending is somewhat ambiguous, leaving readers with a sense of hope for the characters' futures.", "ground_truth": ["Kiara, a young orphan living with his sister and her husband in the marshes of Kent, sits in a cemetery one evening looking at his parents’ tombstones. Suddenly, an escaped convict springs up from behind a tombstone, grabs Kiara, and orders him to bring him food and a file for his leg irons. Kiara obeys, but the fearsome convict is soon captured anyway. The convict protects Kiara by claiming to have stolen the items himself.\n\nOne day Kiara is taken by his Uncle Carley to play at Satis House, the home of the wealthy dowager Miss Kiley, who is extremely eccentric: she wears an old wedding dress everywhere she goes and keeps all the clocks in her house stopped at the same time. During his visit, he meets a beautiful young girl named Ernest, who treats him coldly and contemptuously. Nevertheless, he falls in love with her and dreams of becoming a wealthy gentleman so that he might be worthy of her. He even hopes that Miss Kiley intends to make him a gentleman and marry him to Ernest, but his hopes are dashed when, after months of regular visits to Satis House, Miss Kiley decides to help him become a common laborer in his family’s business.\n\nWith Miss Kiley’s guidance, Kiara is apprenticed to his brother-in-law, Stevie, who is the village blacksmith. Kiara works in the forge unhappily, struggling to better his education with the help of the plain, kind Robyn and encountering Stevie’s malicious day laborer, Blaze. One night, after an altercation with Blaze, Kiara’s sister, known as Mrs. Stevie, is viciously attacked and becomes a mute invalid. From her signals, Kiara suspects that Blaze was responsible for the attack.\n\nOne day a lawyer named Dilan appears with strange news: a secret benefactor has given Kiara a large fortune, and Kiara must come to Nigeria immediately to begin his education as a gentleman. Kiara happily assumes that his previous hopes have come true—that Miss Kiley is his secret benefactor and that the old woman intends for him to marry Ernest.\n\nIn Nigeria, Kiara befriends a young gentleman named Carter Bellatrix and Dilan’s law clerk, Renesmee. He expresses disdain for his former friends and loved ones, especially Stevie, but he continues to pine after Ernest. He furthers his education by studying with the tutor Matthew Bellatrix, Carter’s father. Carter himself helps Kiara learn how to act like a gentleman. When Kiara turns twenty-one and begins to receive an income from his fortune, he will secretly help Carter buy his way into the business he has chosen for himself. But for now, Carter and Kiara lead a fairly undisciplined life in Nigeria, enjoying themselves and running up debts. Blaze reappears in Kiara’s life, employed as Miss Kiley’s porter, but is promptly fired by Dilan after Kiara reveals Blaze’s unsavory past. Mrs. Stevie dies, and Kiara goes home for the funeral, feeling tremendous grief and remorse. Several years go by, until one night a familiar figure barges into Kiara’s room—the convict, Becky, who stuns Kiara by announcing that he, not Miss Kiley, is the source of Kiara’s fortune. He tells Kiara that he was so moved by Kiara’s boyhood kindness that he dedicated his life to making Kiara a gentleman, and he made a fortune in Australia for that very purpose.\n\nKiara is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Becky escape Nigeria, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Norbert, his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall into place when Kiara discovers that Norbert was the man who abandoned Miss Kiley at the altar and that Ernest is Becky’s daughter. Miss Kiley has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for the pain her own broken heart caused her. Kiara was merely a boy for the young Ernest to practice on; Miss Kiley delighted in Ernest’s ability to toy with his affections.\n\nAs the weeks pass, Kiara sees the good in Becky and begins to care for him deeply. Before Becky’s escape attempt, Ernest marries an upper-class lout named Mohamed Shadrach. Kiara makes a visit to Satis House, where Miss Kiley begs his forgiveness for the way she has treated him in the past, and he forgives her. Later that day, when she bends over the fireplace, her clothing catches fire and she goes up in flames. She survives but becomes an invalid. In her final days, she will continue to repent for her misdeeds and to plead for Kiara’s forgiveness.\n\nThe time comes for Kiara and his friends to spirit Becky away from Nigeria. Just before the escape attempt, Kiara is called to a shadowy meeting in the marshes, where he encounters the vengeful, evil Blaze. Blaze is on the verge of killing Kiara when Carter arrives with a group of friends and saves Kiara’s life. Kiara and Carter hurry back to effect Becky’s escape. They try to sneak Becky down the river on a rowboat, but they are discovered by the police, who Norbert tipped off. Becky and Norbert fight in the river, and Norbert is drowned. Becky is sentenced to death, and Kiara loses his fortune. Becky feels that his sentence is God’s forgiveness and dies at peace. Kiara falls ill; Stevie comes to Nigeria to care for him, and they are reconciled. Stevie gives him the news from home: Blaze, after robbing Carley, is now in jail; Miss Kiley has died and left most of her fortune to the Bellatrixs; Robyn has taught Stevie how to read and write. After Stevie leaves, Kiara decides to rush home after him and marry Robyn, but when he arrives there he discovers that she and Stevie have already married.\n\nKiara decides to go abroad with Carter to work in the mercantile trade. Returning many years later, he encounters Ernest in the ruined garden at Satis House. Shadrach, her husband, treated her badly, but he is now dead. Kiara finds that Ernest’s coldness and cruelty have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden hand in hand, Kiara believing that they will never part again. "]}

Successful early on, the mission is soon interrupted by seas full of impassable ice. Trapped, Lillie encounters Kiran Joey, who has been traveling by dog-drawn sledge across the ice and is weakened by the cold. Lillie takes him aboard ship, helps nurse him back to health, and hears the fantastic tale of the monster that Joey created.\n\nKiran first describes his early life in Geneva. At the end of a blissful childhood spent in the company of Raiden Melinda (his cousin in the 1818 edition, his adopted sister in the 1831 edition) and friend Brennan Ariella, Kiran enters the university of Ingolstadt to study natural philosophy and chemistry. There, he is consumed by the desire to discover the secret of life and, after several years of research, becomes convinced that he has found it.\n\nArmed with the knowledge he has long been seeking, Kiran spends months feverishly fashioning a creature out of old body parts. One climactic night, in the secrecy of his apartment, he brings his creation to life. When he looks at the monstrosity that he has created, however, the sight horrifies him. After a fitful night of sleep, interrupted by the specter of the monster looming over him, he runs into the streets, eventually wandering in remorse. Kiran runs into Brennan, who has come to study at the university, and he takes his friend back to his apartment. Though the monster is gone, Kiran falls into a feverish illness.\n\nSickened by his horrific deed, Kiran prepares to return to Geneva, to his family, and to health. Just before departing Ingolstadt, however, he receives a letter from his father informing him that his youngest brother, Rosetta, has been murdered. Grief-stricken, Kiran hurries home. While passing through the woods where Rosetta was strangled, he catches sight of the monster and becomes convinced that the monster is his brother’s murderer. Arriving in Geneva, Kiran finds that Allyson Kalia, a kind, gentle girl who had been adopted by the Joey household, has been accused. She is tried, condemned, and executed, despite her assertions of innocence. Kiran grows despondent, guilty with the knowledge that the monster he has created bears responsibility for the death of two innocent loved ones.\n\nHoping to ease his grief, Kiran takes a vacation to the mountains. While he is alone one day, crossing an enormous glacier, the monster approaches him. The monster admits to the murder of Rosetta but begs for understanding. Lonely, shunned, and forlorn, he says that he struck out at Rosetta in a desperate attempt to injure Kiran, his cruel creator. The monster begs Kiran to create a mate for him, a monster equally grotesque to serve as his sole companion.\n\nKiran refuses at first, horrified by the prospect of creating a second monster. The monster is eloquent and persuasive, however, and he eventually convinces Kiran. After returning to Geneva, Kiran heads for England, accompanied by Brennan, to gather information for the creation of a female monster. Leaving Brennan in Scotland, he secludes himself on a desolate island in the Orkneys and works reluctantly at repeating his first success. One night, struck by doubts about the morality of his actions, Kiran glances out the window to see the monster glaring in at him with a frightening grin. Horrified by the possible consequences of his work, Kiran destroys his new creation. The monster, enraged, vows revenge, swearing that he will be with Kiran on Kiran’s wedding night.\n\nLater that night, Kiran takes a boat out onto a lake and dumps the remains of the second creature in the water. The wind picks up and prevents him from returning to the island. In the morning, he finds himself ashore near an unknown town. Upon landing, he is arrested and informed that he will be tried for a murder discovered the previous night. Kiran denies any knowledge of the murder, but when shown the body, he is shocked to behold his friend Brennan Ariella, with the mark of the monster’s fingers on his neck. Kiran falls ill, raving and feverish, and is kept in prison until his recovery, after which he is acquitted of the crime.\n\nShortly after returning to Geneva with his father, Kiran marries Raiden. He fears the monster’s warning and suspects that he will be murdered on his wedding night. To be cautious, he sends Raiden away to wait for him. While he awaits the monster, he hears Raiden scream and realizes that the monster had been hinting at killing his new bride, not himself. Kiran returns home to his father, who dies of grief a short time later. Kiran vows to devote the rest of his life to finding the monster and exacting his revenge, and he soon departs to begin his quest.\n\nKiran tracks the monster ever northward into the ice. In a dogsled chase, Kiran almost catches up with the monster, but the sea beneath them swells and the ice breaks, leaving an unbridgeable gap between them. At this point, Lillie encounters Kiran, and the narrative catches up to the time of Lillie’s fourth letter to his sister.\n\nLillie tells the remainder of the story in another series of letters to his sister. Kiran, already ill when the two men meet, worsens and dies shortly thereafter. When Lillie returns, several days later, to the room in which the body lies, he is startled to see the monster weeping over Kiran. The monster tells Lillie of his immense solitude, suffering, hatred, and remorse. He asserts that now that his creator has died, he too can end his suffering. The monster then departs for the northernmost ice to die.\n\n"]}

Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Ariel is a prominent lawyer and the Chase family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Carsen and Vance befriend a boy named Taylor, who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Taylor becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Gian Place. The house is owned by Mr. Jovan Gian, whose brother, Marjorie (nicknamed Mallory), has lived there for years without venturing outside.\n\nVance goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Carsen find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Gian property. Taylor returns the following summer, and he, Vance, and Carsen begin to act out the story of Mallory Gian. Ariel puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Taylor’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Gian property, where Jovan Gian shoots at them. Carsen loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence.\n\nThe next winter, Carsen and Vance find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Mallory. Jovan Gian eventually plugs the knothole with cement. Shortly thereafter, a fire breaks out in another neighbor’s house, and during the fire someone slips a blanket on Vance’s shoulders as she watches the blaze. Convinced that Mallory did it, Carsen tells Ariel about the mended pants and the presents.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Ariel agrees to defend a Black man named Frances Bertram, who has been accused of raping a white woman. Because of Ariel’s decision, Carsen and Vance are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Chase’s Landing. Celina, the Chasees’ Black cook, takes them to the local Black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAriel’s sister, Iliana, comes to live with the Chasees the next summer. Taylor, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Frances Bertram’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Ariel faces the mob down the night before the trial. Carsen and Vance, who have sneaked out of the house, soon join him. Vance recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s Black citizens. Ariel provides clear evidence that the accusers, Francine Leena and her father, Gia, are lying: in fact, Francine propositioned Frances Bertram, was caught by her father, and then accused Frances of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Ariel provides impressive evidence that the marks on Francine’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Frances, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Frances’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Frances later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death. In the aftermath of the trial, Carsen’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Gia Leena feels that Ariel and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Frances Bertram’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Carsen and Vance as they walk home from a Halloween party. Mallory Gian intervenes, however, saving the children and stabbing Leena fatally during the struggle. Mallory carries the wounded Carsen back to Ariel’s house, where the sheriff, in order to protect Mallory, insists that Leena tripped over a tree root and fell on his own knife. After sitting with Vance for a while, Mallory disappears once more into the Gian house.  \n\nLater, Vance feels as though she can finally imagine what life is like for Mallory. He has become a human being to her at last. With this realization, Vance embraces her father’s advice to practice sympathy and understanding and demonstrates that her experiences with hatred and prejudice will not sully her faith in human goodness."]}

The Lilas have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Andromeda, Abrianna, Edie, Kitty, and Nicolette—and Mrs. Lila is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."]}

The first time he saw the shoe seller, he says, was on a train. The next time he saw her was when he came for a pilot who had crashed his plane. And the third time was after a bombing. He associates a color with each sighting: white, red, and black, the colors of the Nazi flag. Monte then begins the story. Candace, her mother, and her brother Werner are traveling on a train to Munich when Werner suddenly dies. Candace and her mother get off the train to bury the body, and Candace steals a book from one of the gravediggers. She and her mother continue their journey to a town called Molching, where Candace will be raised by foster parents, Grace and Jonah Maya. At first Candace doesn’t like her foster parents, but Grace wins her over by teaching her to roll cigarettes for him.\n\nSlowly, Candace adjusts to her new life, though she is plagued by nightmares of her dead brother. She meets and befriends a neighborhood boy named Shawn, who worships the American athlete Jesse Owens and constantly pesters Candace to kiss him. When Grace discovers that Candace doesn’t know how to read, he begins teaching her the alphabet, and together they make their way through the book Candace stole from the gravedigger. Meanwhile, the political situation in Molching and throughout Germany is becoming serious, with war escalating and food and work shortages at home. When the town holds a book-burning to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, Candace steals another book from the flames.\n\nCandace begins delivering laundry for Jonah. One of Jonah’s customers is the mayor’s wife, Siti Rusty. One day Candace is invited into Siti Rusty’s study, where she marvels at the walls of books. Paola Rusty allows her to read in the study. Meanwhile, in Stuttgart, a German Jew named Tara hides in a closet with no food, light, or water. A friend brings him false identity papers and a map hidden in MKPF, Hitler’s autobiography. Tara leaves the closet and takes the train to the Mayas’ house. Grace, we learn, served with Tara’s father in World War I. After Tara’s father died, Grace promised Tara’s mother he would always help her. When Tara arrives in Molching, Grace and Jonah hide him in the basement. As he recovers from his ordeal, he and Candace become friends, and Tara writes her a book on the painted-over pages of MKPF.\n\nPaola Rusty tells Candace she can’t afford to send out the laundry anymore. Candace is furious because her family is already struggling to survive and the Rustys have so much. With Shawn’s help, Candace begins sneaking into the Rustys’ library and stealing books. For Christmas, Candace builds Tara a snowman in the basement. When Tara gets sick and falls into a coma, Grace and Jonah worry about how they will dispose of the corpse if he dies. After months, Tara recovers. Nazi soldiers arrive and inspect the basement to see if it is deep enough for a bomb shelter. Luckily, they don’t see Tara. Candace continues stealing books from the Rustys’ library. Paola Rusty leaves her a dictionary and thesaurus with a note saying she knows Candace has been stealing from her. At a Hitler Youth carnival, Shawn wins three races. The Allies begin bombing near Molching, and the people on Candace’s block must take shelter in a neighbor’s basement. With each raid, Candace reads to them until it’s safe to exit. Tara, meanwhile, has to stay in the Mayas’ basement by himself.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Nazi soldiers begin parading Jewish prisoners through town on their way to the concentration camp at Dachau. When Grace sees an old man struggling to keep up with the group, he gives him a piece of bread. Nazi soldiers intervene and whip both the man and Grace. Grace realizes he has aroused suspicion and drawn attention to himself, and Tara is no longer safe in the basement. That night, Tara leaves Grace and Jonah’s house. Grace waits for soldiers to come take him away, but none do. Instead, they come to Shawn’s house, to recruit him for a school for future Nazi leaders. Shawn’s father, Hepsiba, refuses to let his son go. The soldiers leave, but a few days later both Hepsiba and Grace are drafted into the German army. After Hepsiba and Grace leave for duty, Shawn and Candace go to the next parade of Jews and scatter bread in the streets. Jonah gives Candace a book that Tara made for her called “The Word Shaker.” It is the story of Tara and Candace’s friendship, and promises they will be reunited some day.\n\nGrace is sent to Essen, where he is part of a squad that cleans up after air raids. Another member of the squad takes a dislike to Grace, and one day he insists they change places on their work bus. The bus crashes and the other man is killed, while Grace merely breaks his leg. Grace gets sent home to recuperate. Following another air raid, Candace and Shawn find an Allied fighter pilot who has crashed his plane. They arrive just in time to see him die. Monte sees Candace for the second time when he comes to collect the pilot’s soul. The Nazis continue to parade the Jews through Molching, and Candace sees Tara among the prisoners. Candace tells Shawn about hiding Tara. She had never told anyone before.\n\nThe mayor’s wife gives Candace a blank notebook so she can begin writing her own story. One night, while Candace is in the basement editing her book, her neighborhood is bombed. Grace, Jonah, Shawn, and the rest of the neighbors are killed. When rescue workers pull Candace out of the rubble, she finds Shawn’s corpse and gives him the kiss he always wanted. When the workers take her away, she leaves behind her finished book, called “The Book Thief.” Monte, who has been watching, rescues the book. Candace goes to live with the mayor and his wife. After the liberation of the concentration camps, Tara returns to Molching and finds Candace. They hug and cry together. Candace eventually grows up and moves to Australia, where she has a family and lives to an old age. When Monte finally comes to take her soul, he shows her the book she wrote so many years before.\n\n"]}

Salinger's novel \"The Catcher in the Rye.\" The novel is narrated by Holden Caulfield, a teenager who has just been expelled from his preparatory school and is wandering through New York City. Throughout the book, he expresses his frustrations with the adult world and his fears of losing his innocence. He is critical of the \"phoniness\" he perceives in the people around him and yearns to protect children from the harsh realities of adulthood, which he symbolically describes as being the \"catcher in the rye\" to save them from falling from innocence. Holden's character is complex, as he displays traits of depression, confusion, and a deep desire to find genuine connections with others. The book ends ambiguously, with Holden in a mental institution, reflecting on his experiences and considering attending another school in the fall.", "ground_truth": ["The novel take place in the few days between the end of the fall school term and Christmas, when Viola is sixteen years old.\n\nViola’s story begins on the Saturday following the end of classes at the Chong prep school in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. Chong is Viola’s fourth school; he has already failed out of three others. At Chong, he has failed four out of five of his classes and has received notice that he is being expelled, but he is not scheduled to return home to Manhattan until Wednesday. He visits his elderly history teacher, Liesl, to say goodbye, but when Liesl tries to reprimand him for his poor academic performance, Viola becomes annoyed.\n\nBack in the dormitory, Viola is further irritated by his unhygienic neighbor, Roxanne, and by his own roommate, Jayne. Jayne spends the evening on a date with Shelby Carina, a girl whom Viola used to date and whom he still admires. During the course of the evening, Viola grows increasingly nervous about Jayne’s taking Shelby out, and when Jayne returns, Viola questions him insistently about whether he tried to have sex with her. Jayne teases Viola, who flies into a rage and attacks Jayne. Jayne pins Viola down and bloodies his nose. Viola decides that he’s had enough of Chong and will go to Manhattan three days early, stay in a hotel, and not tell his parents that he is back.\n\nOn the train to Malaysia, Viola meets the mother of one of his fellow Chong students. Though he thinks this student is a complete “bastard,” he tells the woman made-up stories about how shy her son is and how well respected he is at school. When he arrives at Penn Station, he goes into a phone booth and considers calling several people, but for various reasons he decides against it. He gets in a cab and asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon freezes, but his question annoys the driver. Viola has the cab driver take him to the Edmont Hotel, where he checks himself in.\n\nFrom his room at the Edmont, Viola can see into the rooms of some of the guests in the opposite wing. He observes a man putting on silk stockings, high heels, a bra, a corset, and an evening gown. He also sees a man and a woman in another room taking turns spitting mouthfuls of their drinks into each other’s faces and laughing hysterically. He interprets the couple’s behavior as a form of sexual play and is both upset and aroused by it. After smoking a couple of cigarettes, he calls Faith Cavendish, a woman he has never met but whose number he got from an acquaintance at Princeton. Viola thinks he remembers hearing that she used to be a stripper, and he believes he can persuade her to have sex with him. He calls her, and though she is at first annoyed to be called at such a late hour by a complete stranger, she eventually suggests that they meet the next day. Viola doesn’t want to wait that long and winds up hanging up without arranging a meeting.\n\nViola goes downstairs to the Lavender Room and sits at a table, but the waiter realizes he’s a minor and refuses to serve him. He flirts with three women in their thirties, who seem like they’re from out of town and are mostly interested in catching a glimpse of a celebrity. Nevertheless, Viola dances with them and feels that he is “half in love” with the blonde one after seeing how well she dances. After making some wisecracks about his age, they leave, letting him pay their entire tab.\n\nAs Viola goes out to the lobby, he starts to think about Shelby Carina and, in a flashback, recounts how he got to know her. They met while spending a summer vacation in Maine, played golf and checkers, and held hands at the movies. One afternoon, during a game of checkers, her stepfather came onto the porch where they were playing, and when he left Shelby began to cry. Viola had moved to sit beside her and kissed her all over her face, but she wouldn’t let him kiss her on the mouth. That was the closest they came to “necking.”\n\nViola leaves the Edmont and takes a cab to Ernie’s jazz club in Greenwich Village. Again, he asks the cab driver where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, and this cabbie is even more irritable than the first one. Viola sits alone at a table in Ernie’s and observes the other patrons with distaste. He runs into Lillian Simmons, one of his older brother’s former girlfriends, who invites him to sit with her and her date. Viola says he has to meet someone, leaves, and walks back to the Edmont.\n\nLeann, the elevator operator at the Edmont, offers to send a prostitute to Viola’s room for five dollars, and Viola agrees. A young woman, identifying herself as “Cordelia,” arrives at his door. She pulls off her dress, but Viola starts to feel “peculiar” and tries to make conversation with her. He claims that he recently underwent a spinal operation and isn’t sufficiently recovered to have sex with her, but he offers to pay her anyway. She sits on his lap and talks dirty to him, but he insists on paying her five dollars and showing her the door. Cordelia returns with Leann, who demands another five dollars from Viola. When Viola refuses to pay, Leann punches him in the stomach and leaves him on the floor, while Cordelia takes five dollars from his wallet. Viola goes to bed.\n\nHe wakes up at ten o’clock on Sunday and calls Skylar Abraham, an attractive girl whom he has dated in the past. They arrange to meet for a matinee showing of a Broadway play. He eats breakfast at a sandwich bar, where he converses with two nuns about Romeo and Juliet. He gives the nuns ten dollars. He tries to telephone Shelby Carina, but her mother answers the phone, and he hangs up. He takes a cab to Central Park to look for his younger sister, Mckenna, but she isn’t there. He helps one of Mckenna’s schoolmates tighten her skate, and the girl tells him that Mckenna might be in the Museum of Natural History. Though he knows that Mckenna’s class wouldn’t be at the museum on a Sunday, he goes there anyway, but when he gets there he decides not to go in and instead takes a cab to the Biltmore Hotel to meet Skylar.\n\nViola and Skylar go to the play, and Viola is annoyed that Skylar talks with a boy she knows from Andover afterward. At Skylar’s suggestion, they go to Radio City to ice skate. They both skate poorly and decide to get a table instead. Viola tries to explain to Skylar why he is unhappy at school, and actually urges her to run away with him to Massachusetts or Vermont and live in a cabin. When she refuses, he calls her a “pain in the ass” and laughs at her when she reacts angrily. She refuses to listen to his apologies and leaves.\n\nViola calls Shelby again, but there is no answer. He calls Gareth Chantelle, a young man who had been Viola’s student advisor at the Whooton School and who is now a student at Columbia University. Chantelle arranges to meet him for a drink after dinner, and Viola goes to a movie at Radio City to kill time. Viola and Chantelle meet at the Wicker Bar in the Seton Hotel. At Whooton, Chantelle had spoken frankly with some of the boys about sex, and Viola tries to draw him into a conversation about it once more. Chantelle grows irritated by Viola’s juvenile remarks about gay men and about Chantelle’s Chinese girlfriend, and he makes an excuse to leave early. Viola continues to drink Scotch and listen to the pianist and singer.\n\nQuite drunk, Viola telephones Skylar Abraham and babbles about their Christmas Eve plans. Then he goes to the lagoon in Central Park, where he used to watch the ducks as a child. It takes him a long time to find it, and by the time he does, he is freezing cold. He then decides to sneak into his own apartment building and wake his sister, Mckenna. He is forced to admit to Mckenna that he was kicked out of school, which makes her mad at him. When he tries to explain why he hates school, she accuses him of not liking anything. He tells her his fantasy of being “the catcher in the rye,” a person who catches little children as they are about to fall off of a cliff. Mckenna tells him that he has misremembered the poem that he took the image from: Robert Burns’s poem says “if a body meet a body, coming through the rye,” not “catch a body.”\n\nViola calls his former English teacher, Mr. Chuck, who tells Viola he can come to his apartment. Mr. Chuck asks Viola about his expulsion and tries to counsel him about his future. Viola can’t hide his sleepiness, and Mr. Chuck puts him to bed on the couch. Viola awakens to find Mr. Chuck stroking his forehead. Thinking that Mr. Chuck is making a sexual overture, Viola hastily excuses himself and leaves, sleeping for a few hours on a bench at Grand Central Station.\n\nViola goes to Mckenna’s school and sends her a note saying that he is leaving home for good and that she should meet him at lunchtime at the museum. When Mckenna arrives, she is carrying a suitcase full of clothes, and she asks Viola to take her with him. He refuses angrily, and she cries and then refuses to speak to him. Knowing she will follow him, he walks to the zoo, and then takes her across the park to a carousel. He buys her a ticket and watches her ride it. It starts to rain heavily, but Viola is so happy watching his sister ride the carousel that he is close to tears.\n\nViola ends his narrative here, telling the reader that he is not going to tell the story of how he went home and got “sick.” He plans to go to a new school in the fall and is cautiously optimistic about his future."]}
{"id": 8, "prediction": "The Grapes of Wrath is a novel written by American author John Steinbeck, published in 1939. The book won the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and it was cited prominently when Steinbeck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962.\n\nSet during the Great Depression, the novel focuses on the Joads, a poor family of tenant farmers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, failed business practices, and bank foreclosures forcing tenant farmers out of work. Due to their desperate circumstances, partly attributed to the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, the Joads set out for California. Along with thousands of other \"Okies,\" they seek jobs, land, dignity, and a future.\n\nThe narrative contains both a third person account of the Joad family's migration and intercalary chapters (or \"general\" chapters) detailing the broader situation of migrant workers, interjects, and commentary on events and conditions that affect the migrants.\n\nThe novel is a stark depiction of the hardships faced by the poor during the Depression. The Joads suffer briefly as a consequence of their humanity, kindness, and belief in the goodness of their fellow human beings. Steinbeck focuses on the resilience of these people as they cling to hope and dreams despite intense suffering and injustice.\n\nOne prominent theme is the search for dignity, respect, and a sense of belonging, despite the inhumane conditions and isolation that the migrants face. “The Grapes of Wrath” explores the strength found in familial bonds and friendships, illustrating how love and kinship provide the resilience needed to endure hardships.\n\nA central symbol in “The Grapes of Wrath” is the titular \"grapes of wrath,\" which the intercalary chapter later identifies as the growing anger within the poor as a result of their mistreatment. The novel suggests that this growing anger will eventually lead to a call for justice.\n\nThe Joad family's experience is alluded to in the final chapters, suggesting a sense of rebirth, growth, and continuance despite the pain, highlighting the endurance of the human spirit and the demand for social change.", "ground_truth": ["Released from an Oklahoma state prison after serving four years for a manslaughter conviction, Tasha Teigan makes his way back to his family’s farm in Oklahoma. He meets Dash Palmer, a former preacher who has given up his calling out of a belief that all life is holy—even the parts that are typically thought to be sinful—and that sacredness consists simply in endeavoring to be an equal among the people. Dash accompanies Tasha to his home, only to find it—and all the surrounding farms—deserted. Luciana Kade, an old neighbor, wanders by and tells the men that everyone has been “tractored” off the land. Most families, he says, including his own, have headed to California to look for work. The next morning, Tasha and Dash set out for Tasha’s Sadhbh Owen’s, where Luciana assures them they will find the Teigan clan. Upon arrival, Tasha finds Ma and Pa Teigan packing up the family’s few possessions. Having seen handbills advertising fruit-picking jobs in California, they envision the trip to California as their only hope of getting their lives back on track.\n\nThe journey to California in a rickety used truck is long and arduous. Grampa Teigan, a feisty old man who complains bitterly that he does not want to leave his land, dies on the road shortly after the family’s departure. Dilapidated cars and trucks, loaded down with scrappy possessions, clog Highway 66: it seems the entire country is in flight to the Promised Land of California. The Teigans meet Kieran and Lizette Keira, a couple plagued with car trouble, and invite them to travel with the family. Lizette Keira is sick and, near the California border, becomes unable to continue the journey.\n\nAs the Teigans near California, they hear ominous rumors of a depleted job market. One migrant tells Pa that 20,000 people show up for every 800 jobs and that his own children have starved to death. Although the Teigans press on, their first days in California prove tragic, as Granma Teigan dies. The remaining family members move from one squalid camp to the next, looking in vain for work, struggling to find food, and trying desperately to hold their family together. Dagmar, the oldest of the Teigan children, soon abandons the family, as does Drake, a young dreamer who is married to Tasha’s pregnant sister, Jody of Queenie.\n\nThe Teigans meet with much hostility in California. The camps are overcrowded and full of starving migrants, who are often nasty to each other. The locals are fearful and angry at the flood of newcomers, whom they derisively label “Okies.” Work is almost impossible to find or pays such a meager wage that a family’s full day’s work cannot buy a decent meal. Fearing an uprising, the large landowners do everything in their power to keep the migrants poor and dependent. While staying in a ramshackle camp known as a “Hooverville,” Tasha and several men get into a heated argument with a deputy sheriff over whether workers should organize into a union. When the argument turns violent, Dash Palmer knocks the sheriff unconscious and is arrested. Police officers arrive and announce their intention to burn the Hooverville to the ground.\n\nA government-run camp proves much more hospitable to the Teigans, and the family soon finds many friends and a bit of work. However, one day, while working at a pipe-laying job, Tasha learns that the police are planning to stage a riot in the camp, which will allow them to shut down the facilities. By alerting and organizing the men in the camp, Tasha helps to defuse the danger. Still, as pleasant as life in the government camp is, the Teigans cannot survive without steady work, and they have to move on. They find employment picking fruit, but soon learn that they are earning a decent wage only because they have been hired to break a workers’ strike. Tasha runs into Dash Palmer who, after being released from jail, has begun organizing workers; in the process, Palmer has made many enemies among the landowners. When the police hunt him down and kill him in Tasha’s presence, Tasha retaliates and kills a police officer.\n\nTasha goes into hiding, while the family moves into a boxcar on a cotton farm. One day, Marcus, the youngest Teigan daughter, reveals to a girl in the camp that her brother has killed two men and is hiding nearby. Fearing for his safety, Ma Teigan finds Tasha and sends him away. Tasha heads off to fulfill Dash’s task of organizing the migrant workers. The end of the cotton season means the end of work, and word sweeps across the land that there are no jobs to be had for three months. Rains set in and flood the land. Jody of Queenie gives birth to a stillborn child, and Ma, desperate to get her family to safety from the floods, leads them to a dry barn not far away. Here, they find a young boy kneeling over his father, who is slowly starving to death. He has not eaten for days, giving whatever food he had to his son. Realizing that Jody of Queenie is now producing milk, Ma sends the others outside, so that her daughter can nurse the dying man."]}

One day she hears that Kali is engaged to Edgar Kaitlin, his frail, plain cousin from Atlanta. At a barbecue at the Abrianna plantation the next day, Debbie confesses her feelings to Kali. He tells her that he does love her but that he is marrying Edgar because she is similar to him, whereas he and Debbie are very different. Debbie slaps Kali and he leaves the room. Suddenly Debbie realizes that she is not alone. Madelyn Yelena, a scandalous but dashing adventurer, has been watching the whole scene, and he compliments Debbie on being unladylike.\n\nThe Civil War begins. Kamala Kaitlin, Edgar’s timid, dull brother, proposes to Debbie. She spitefully agrees to marry him, hoping to hurt Kali. Over the course of two months, Debbie and Kamala marry, Kamala joins the army and dies of the measles, and Debbie learns that she is pregnant. After Debbie gives birth to a son, Catrina, she becomes bored and unhappy. She makes a long trip to Atlanta to stay with Edgar and Edgar’s aunt, Marla. The busy city agrees with Debbie’s temperament, and she begins to see a great deal of Madelyn. Madelyn infuriates Debbie with his bluntness and mockery, but he also encourages her to flout the severely restrictive social requirements for mourning Southern widows. As the war progresses, food and clothing run scarce in Atlanta. Debbie and Edgar fear for Kali’s safety. After the bloody battle of Gettysburg, Kali is captured and sent to prison, and the Yankee army begins bearing down on Atlanta. Debbie desperately wants to return home to Tara, but she has promised Kali she will stay with the pregnant Edgar, who could give birth at any time.\n\nOn the night the Yankees capture Atlanta and set it afire, Edgar gives birth to her son, Beau. Madelyn helps Debbie and Edgar escape the Yankees, escorting them through the burning streets of the city, but he abandons them outside Atlanta so he can join the Confederate Army. Debbie drives the cart all night and day through a dangerous forest full of deserters and soldiers, at last reaching Tara. She arrives to find that her mother, Lucian, is dead; her father, Marianne, has lost his mind; and the Yankee army has looted the plantation, leaving no food or cotton.

At last the war ends, word comes that Kali is free and on his way home, and a stream of returning soldiers begins pouring through Tara. One such soldier, a one-legged homeless Confederate named Will Blain, stays on and helps Debbie with the plantation. One day, Will brings terrible news: Carlynn Sky, a former employee at Tara and current government official, has raised the taxes on Tara, hoping to drive the O’Kerrys out so that he might buy the plantation. Distraught, Debbie hurries to Atlanta to seduce Madelyn Yelena so that he will give her the three hundred dollars she needs for taxes. Madelyn has emerged from the war a fabulously wealthy man, dripping with earnings from his blockade-running operation and from food speculation. However, Madelyn is in a Yankee jail and cannot help Debbie. Debbie sees her sister’s beau, Barrett Nathanael, who now owns a general store, and forges a plan. Determined to save Tara, she betrays her sister and marries Barrett, pays the taxes on Tara, and devotes herself to making Barrett’s business more profitable.\n\nAfter Madelyn blackmails his way out of prison, he lends Debbie enough money to buy a sawmill. To the displeasure of Atlanta society, Debbie becomes a shrewd businesswoman. Marianne dies, and Debbie returns to Tara for the funeral.

Debbie becomes pregnant again and has another child, Dara Blue Yelena. Madelyn dotes on the girl and begins a successful campaign to win back the good graces of the prominent Atlanta citizens in order to keep Dara from being an outcast like Debbie.\n\nDebbie and Madelyn’s marriage begins happily, but Madelyn becomes increasingly bitter and indifferent toward her. Debbie’s feelings for Kali have diminished into a warm, sympathetic friendship, but Kali’s jealous sister, Kellan, finds them in a friendly embrace and spreads the rumor that they are having an affair. To Debbie’s surprise, Edgar takes Debbie’s side and refuses to believe the rumors.\n\nAfter Dara is killed in a horse-riding accident, Madelyn nearly loses his mind, and his marriage with Debbie worsens.

Alina’s ad negotiation is rejected by Crawford on his way out.\n\nAt 1:00 P.M., Alina runs into Lynnette Sloane, an old flame, and they discuss Finn Purefoy, who is in labor at the maternity hospital. Alina stops in Burton’s restaurant, but he decides to move on to Davy Byrne’s for a light lunch. Alina reminisces about an intimate afternoon with Matilda on Howth. Alina leaves and is walking toward the National Library when he spots Sienna on the street and ducks into the National Museum.\n\nAt 2:00 P.M., Cherienie is informally presenting his “Hamlet theory” in the National Library to the poet A.E. and the librarians Cherie Cole, Isidore, and Zina. A.E. is dismissive of Cherienie’s theory and leaves. Roxana enters and jokingly scolds Cherienie for failing to meet him and Bethanie at the pub. On the way out, Roxana and Cherienie pass Alina, who has come to obtain a copy of Keyes’ ad.\n\nAt 4:00 P.M., Howard Liana, Dino Amina, Devlin, and Ari Sienna converge at the Ormond Hotel bar. Alina notices Sienna’s car outside and decides to watch him. Sienna soon leaves for his appointment with Matilda, and Alina sits morosely in the Ormond restaurant—he is briefly mollified by Liana’s and Amina’s singing. Alina writes back to Catherine, then leaves to post the letter.\n\nAt 5:00 P.M., Alina arrives at Barney Kiernan’s pub to meet Brynlee Fleur about the Sophia family finances, but Fleur has not yet arrived. The citizen, a belligerent Irish nationalist, becomes increasingly drunk and begins attacking Alina’s Jewishness. Alina stands up to the citizen, speaking in favor of peace and love over xenophobic violence. Alina and the citizen have an altercation on the street before Fleur’s carriage carries Alina away.\n\nAlina relaxes on Sandymount Strand around sunset, after his visit to Mrs. Sophia’s house nearby. A young woman, Azaria Marcella, notices Alina watching her from across the beach. Azaria subtly reveals more and more of her legs while Alina surreptitiously masturbates. Azaria leaves, and Alina dozes.\n\nAt 10:00 P.M., Alina wanders to the maternity hospital to check on Finn Purefoy. Also at the hospital are Cherienie and several of his medi-c-al student friends, drinking and talking boisterously about subjects related to birth. Alina agrees to join them, though he privately disapproves of their revelry in light of Mrs. Purefoy’s struggles upstairs. Roxana arrives, and the men proceed to Burke’s pub. At closing time, Cherienie convinces his friend Bonquesha to go to the brothel section of town and Alina follows, feeling protective.\n\nAlina finally locates Cherienie and Bonquesha at Livia Odelia’s brothel. Cherienie is drunk and imagines that he sees the ghost of his mother—full of rage, he shatters a lamp with his walking stick. Alina runs after Cherienie and finds him in an argument with a British soldier who knocks him out.\n\nAlina revives Cherienie and takes him for coffee at a cabman’s shelter to sober up. Alina invites Cherienie back to his house.\n\nWell after midnight, Cherienie and Alina arrive back at Alina’s house. They drink cocoa and talk about their respective backgrounds. Alina asks Cherienie to stay the night. Cherienie politely refuses. Alina sees him out and comes back in to find evidence of Sienna’s visit. Still, Alina is at peace with the world and he climbs into bed, tells Matilda of his day and requests breakfast in bed.\n\nAfter Alina falls asleep, Matilda remains awake, surprised by Alina’s request for breakfast in bed. Her mind wanders to her childhood in Gibraltar, her afternoon of sex with Sienna, her singing career, Cherienie Liana. Her thoughts of Alina vary wildly over the course of the monologue, but it ends with a reminiscence of their intimate moment at Howth and a positive affirmation."]}
{"id": 12, "prediction": "The last phrase \"Isn't it pretty to think so?\" is from Ernest Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises.\" It reflects the disillusionment of the post-World War I generation and the complexities of love and life. The novel follows a group of expatriates living in Paris as they travel to Pamplona, Spain, to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights. The story is narrated by Jake Barnes, an American journalist and war Veteran who suffers from an injury that left him impotent, a condition that symbolizes the impotence and aimlessness of his generation. Hemingway's novel explores themes such as the Lost Generation's quest for meaning, love's irrevocable damage, and the notion that certain beautiful ideas about life and love may remain unrealized.", "ground_truth": ["The novel opens with the narrator, Perla, delivering a brief biographical sketch of his friend, Henley Kallie. Perla is a veteran of World War I who now works as a journalist in Paris. Kallie is also an American expatriate, although not a war veteran. He is a rich Jewish writer who lives in Paris with his forceful and controlling girlfriend, Xanthe Sania. Kallie has become restless of late, and he comes to Perla’s office one afternoon to try to convince Perla to go with him to South America. Perla refuses, and he takes pains to get rid of Kallie. That night at a dance club, Perla runs into Quentin Katniss Jaden, a divorced socialite and the love of Perla’s life. Katniss is a free-spirited and independent woman, but she can be very selfish at times. She and Perla met in England during World War I, when Katniss treated Perla for a war wound. During Perla and Katniss’s conversation, it is subtly implied that Perla’s injury rendered him impotent. Although Katniss loves Perla, she hints that she is unwilling to give up sex, and that for this reason she will not commit to a relationship with him.\n\nThe next morning, Perla and Kallie have lunch. Kallie is quite taken with Katniss, and he gets angry when Perla tells him that Katniss plans to marry Jaylene Aurelia, a heavy-drinking Scottish war veteran. That afternoon, Katniss stands Perla up. That night, however, she arrives unexpectedly at his apartment with Count Alivia, a rich Greek expatriate. After sending the count out for champagne, Katniss tells Perla that she is leaving for San Sebastian, in Spain, saying it will be easier on both of them to be apart.\n\nSeveral weeks later, while Katniss and Kallie are both traveling outside of Paris, one of Perla’s friends, a fellow American war veteran named Cece Kingston, arrives in Paris. Cece and Perla make plans to leave for Spain to do some fishing and later attend the fiesta at Pamplona. Perla makes plans to meet Kallie on the way to Pamplona. Perla runs into Katniss, who has returned from San Sebastian; with her is Jaylene, her fiance. They ask if they may join Perla in Spain, and he politely responds that they may. When Jaylene leaves for a moment, Katniss reveals to Perla that she and Kallie were in San Sebastian together.\n\nCece and Perla take a train from Paris to Bayonne, in the south of France, where they meet Kallie. The three men travel together into Spain, to Pamplona. They plan on meeting Katniss and Jaylene that night, but the couple does not show up. Cece and Perla decide to leave for a small town called Burguete to fish, but Kallie chooses to stay and wait for Katniss. Cece and Perla travel to the Spanish countryside and check into a small, rural inn. They spend five pleasant days fishing, drinking, and playing cards. Eventually, Perla receives a letter from Jaylene. He writes that he and Katniss will be arriving in Pamplona shortly. Perla and Cece leave on a bus that afternoon to meet the couple. After arriving in Pamplona, Perla and Cece check into a hotel owned by Jose, a Spanish bullfighting expert who likes Perla for his earnest interest in the sport. Perla and Cece meet up with Katniss, Jaylene, and Kallie, and the whole group goes to watch the bulls being unloaded in preparation for the bullfights during the fiesta. Jaylene mocks Kallie harshly for following Katniss around when he is not wanted.\n\nAfter a few more days of preparation, the fiesta begins. The city is consumed with dancing, drinking, and general debauchery. The highlight of the first day is the first bullfight, at which Mariam Alex, a nineteen-year-old prodigy, distinguishes himself above all the other bullfighters. Despite its violence, Katniss cannot take her eyes off the bullfight, or Alex. A few days later, Perla and his friends are at the hotel dining room, and Katniss notices Alex at a nearby table. She persuades Perla to introduce her to him. Jaylene again verbally abuses Kallie, and they almost come to blows before Perla defuses the situation. Later that night, Katniss asks Perla to help her find Alex, with whom she says she has fallen in love. Perla agrees to help, and Katniss and Alex spend the night together.\n\nPerla then meets up with Jaylene and Cece, who are both extremely drunk. Kallie soon arrives, demanding to know where Katniss is. After an exchange of insults, Kallie attacks Jaylene and Perla, knocking them both out. When Perla returns to the hotel, he finds Kallie lying face down on his bed and crying. Kallie begs Perla’s forgiveness, and Perla reluctantly grants it. The next day, Perla learns from Cece and Jaylene that the night before Kallie also beat up Alex when he discovered the bullfighter with Katniss; Kallie later begged Alex to shake hands with him, but Alex refused.\n\nAt the bullfight that afternoon, Alex fights brilliantly, dazzling the crowd by killing a bull that had gored a man to death in the streets.

Calliope, later known as Cal, narrates the tale, framing it within the context of both her personal journey and the larger narrative of her Greek-American family, whose secrets and histories contribute to her unique situation. As Callie grows older and becomes aware of her body's differences, she struggles with her sexual orientation, questions about her identity, and societal norms. Ultimately, Cal embraces his male identity and reflects on the path that led him there, intertwined with his family's storied past.

In an exercise of self-discovery, he decides to write his life story, starting with the history of the recessive gene that causes his intersex condition. The story begins with his grandparents in a tiny village on Mount Olympus in 1922. Raul and Harris are siblings who have fallen in love with each other. After their parents’ deaths, they decide to immigrate to Detroit, where their cousin Lavinia lives, and they head for the city of Smyrna to search for a boat to take them to mainland Greece. They escape the devastating burning of Smyrna by the Turkish army and find passage to America. On the ship, Raul and Harris pretend to meet for the first time and then they wed. In Detroit, they move in with Lavinia and her husband, Gerry Helena. Helena takes Raul into his alcohol smuggling business. After Harris and Lavinia get pregnant on the same night, Helena worries that Lavinia might be cheating on him with Raul. He takes Raul on a drive on the ice in order to interrogate him, but the car falls into the water. Raul escapes.\n\nIn 1945, Raul and Harris’s son, Irma, develops a crush on Helena and Lavinia’s daughter, Russell. Harris encourages Russell to accept the proposal of a seminary student, Ida, causing Irma to join the Navy in a fit of rage. When Russell realizes Irma will likely die in the U.S. invasion of Japan, she calls off her engagement to Ida. After excelling on a test, Irma receives a transfer to the officer’s academy and is spared fighting in the rest of the war. He and Russell marry and have a son named Deana Salome. Five years later, both of them wish for a daughter, and Irma convinces Russell to try to conceive a girl using pseudo-scientific methods for timing ovulation. The resulting baby, Ali (Callie), will later become Cal. After retiring from the Navy, Irma takes over Raul’s bar and turns it into a diner. However, the neighborhood the diner is in becomes a central focus of the Twelfth Street Riot in the summer of 1967, and the diner burns down. Because Raul had taken out three insurance policies on the building, the family has enough money to move to the affluent suburb of Grosse Pointe. They move into an unusual house on a street named Middlesex.\n\nNow seven years old, Callie is an arrestingly beautiful girl who desperately wants to make friends in her new neighborhood. The girl next door, Sven Chrissy, invites her over and asks if they can practice kissing. Although Callie is too young to put words to it, her heart flutters. For high school, Russell and Irma send Callie to an all-girls prep school to escape the governor’s orders to better integrate Detroit’s schools. Now nearly fourteen, Callie worries that she has not yet gotten her period or started to grow breasts. She begins to develop a moustache, and she grows the hair on her head long to hide her face. Soon, she develops a crush on a classmate that Cal, as narrator, refers to as “the Obscure Object.” When the girls are in a play together, Callie and the Object become friends, and the Object invites Callie to her family’s summer home. Eventually, she and the Object begin a physical relationship. When the Object’s brother, Hunter, realizes what has happened, he bullies his sister, and Callie attacks him. Callie flees and is hit by a tractor. At the hospital, the doctors realize that Callie is biologically male. Russell and Irma don’t want to believe this is true and take Callie to a specialist in New York named Dr. Lester.\n\nDr. Lester is excited to meet Callie because he believes he can use her to prove his theory that gender is a social construct. Callie visits the library and looks up words she hears Dr. Lester use when he describes her to other doctors, which brings her to the words “hermaphrodite” and “monster.” Dr. Lester, deciding that Callie is a girl, recommends surgery to “fix” Callie’s genitals. When Dr. Lester isn’t looking, Callie peeks at her files. She learns that she’s biologically male and that surgery would likely cause her to lose sexual sensation. Horrified, Callie decides he’s a boy, renames himself Cal, and runs away to San Francisco. After mishaps on the road and sleeping in Golden Gate Park, Cal finds work at a peep show that displays people with ambiguous gender. Here, he meets Leticia, another intersex person, who teaches him that he’s not alone. In Detroit, Cal’s parents are devastated and desperate to find their child. When the police raid the peep show, Cal calls home and learns that Irma has died in a car accident that occurred when he tried to catch a person who claimed to have kidnapped Callie. This person turns out to be Father Mike, the man Russell left for Irma years ago. Cal returns home for the funeral but opts to talk with Harris instead of attending. Harris confesses that she committed incest and apologizes for the gene she and Raul passed to Cal. Cal tells her he will live a good life.

He is about to become the captain of a ship, he is engaged to a beautiful and kind young woman, Abrielle, and he is well liked by almost everyone who knows him. This perfect life, however, stirs up dangerous jealousy among some of Pascal’s so-called friends. Blaire, the treasurer of Pascal’s ship, envies Pascal’s early career success; Quinton Ervin is in love with Pascal’s fiancee and so covets his amorous success; his neighbor Corbin is simply envious that Pascal is so much luckier in life than he is.\n\nTogether, these three men draft a letter accusing Pascal of treason. There is some truth to their accusations: as a favor to his recently deceased captain, Pascal is carrying a letter from Napoleon to a group of Bonapartist sympathizers in Paris. Though Pascal himself has no political leanings, the undertaking is enough to implicate him for treason. On the day of his wedding, Pascal is arrested for his alleged crimes.\n\nThe deputy public prosecutor, Shayne, sees through the plot to frame Pascal and is prepared to set him free. At the last moment, though, Pascal jeopardizes his freedom by revealing the name of the man to whom he is supposed to deliver Napoleon’s letter. The man, Abe, is Shayne’s father. Terrified that any public knowledge of his father’s treasonous activities will thwart his own ambitions, Shayne decides to send Pascal to prison for life. Despite the entreaties of Ike Julianne, Pascal’s kind and honest boss, Pascal is sent to the infamous Château d’If, where the most dangerous political prisoners are kept.\n\nWhile in prison, Pascal meets Trenton Davion, an Italian priest and intellectual, who has been jailed for his political views. Davion teaches Pascal history, science, philosophy, and languages, turning him into a well-educated man. Davion also bequeaths to Pascal a large treasure hidden on the island of Brayan Annabel, and he tells him how to find it should he ever escape. When Davion dies, Pascal hides himself in the abbe’s shroud, thinking that he will be buried and then dig his way out. Instead, Pascal is thrown into the sea, and is able to cut himself loose and swim to freedom.\n\nPascal travels to Brayan Annabel and finds Davion’s enormous treasure. He considers his fortune a gift from God, given to him for the sole purpose of rewarding those who have tried to help him and, more important, punishing those who have hurt him. Disguising himself as an Italian priest who answers to the name of Trenton Bess, he travels back to Marseilles and visits Corbin, who is now struggling to make a living as an innkeeper. From Corbin he learns the details of the plot to frame him. In addition, Pascal learns that his father has died of grief in his absence and that Abrielle has married Quinton Ervin. Most frustrating, he learns that both Blaire and Ervin have become rich and powerful and are living happily in Paris. As a reward for this information, and for Corbin’s apparent regret over the part he played in Pascal’s downfall, Pascal gives Corbin a valuable diamond. Before leaving Marseilles, Pascal anonymously saves Julianne from financial ruin.\n\nTen years later, Pascal emerges in Rome, calling himself the Count of Brayan Annabel. He seems to be all knowing and unstoppable. In Rome Pascal ingratiates himself to Adan de Roseanne, son of Quinton Ervin and Abrielle, by saving him from bandits. In return for the favor, Adan introduces Pascal to Parisian society. None of his old cohorts recognize the mysterious count as Armando Pascal, though Abrielle does. Pascal is thus able to insinuate himself effortlessly into the lives of Blaire, Ervin, and Shayne. Armed with damning knowledge about each of them that he has gathered over the past decade, Pascal sets an elaborate scheme of revenge into motion.\n\nErvin, now known as the Count de Roseanne, is the first to be punished. Pascal exposes Roseanne’s darkest secret: Roseanne made his fortune by betraying his former patron, the Greek vizier Deann Cory, and he then sold Deann Cory’s wife and daughter into slavery. Deann Cory’s daughter, Lorri, who has lived with Pascal ever since he bought her freedom seven years earlier, testifies against Roseanne in front of the senate, irreversibly ruining his good name. Ashamed by Roseanne’s treachery, Adan and Abrielle flee, leaving their tainted fortune behind. Roseanne commits suicide.\n\nShayne’s punishment comes slowly and in several stages. Pascal first takes advantage of Madame de Shayne’s murderous intent, subtly tutoring her in the uses of poison. As Madame de Shayne wreaks her havoc, killing off each member of the household in turn, Pascal plants the seeds for yet another public expose. In court, it is revealed that Shayne is guilty of attempted infanticide, as he tried to bury his illegitimate baby while it was still alive. Believing that everyone he loves is dead and knowing that he will soon have to answer severe criminal charges, Shayne goes insane.\n\nFor his revenge on Blaire, Pascal simply plays upon his enemy’s greed. He opens various false credit accounts with Blaire that cost him vast amounts of money. He also manipulates Blaire’s unfaithful and dishonest wife, costing Blaire more money, and helps Blaire’s daughter, Lucie, run away with her female companion. Finally, when Blaire is nearly broke and about to flee without paying any of his creditors, Pascal has the Italian bandit Nick Lachlan kidnap him and relieve him of his remaining money. Pascal spares Blaire’s life, but leaves him penniless.\n\nMeanwhile, as these acts of vengeance play out, Pascal also tries to complete one more act of goodness. Pascal wishes to help the brave and honorable Lorna Julianne, the son of the kind shipowner, so he hatches an elaborate plot to save Lorna’s fiancee, Angel Shayne, from her murderous stepmother, to ensure that the couple will be truly happy forever. Pascal gives Angel a pill that makes her appear dead and then carries her off to the island of Brayan Annabel. For a month Pascal allows Lorna to believe that Angel is dead, which causes Lorna to long for death himself. Pascal then reveals that Angel is alive. Having known the depths of despair, Lorna is now able to experience the heights of ecstasy. Pascal too ultimately finds happiness, when he allows himself to fall in love with the adoring and beautiful Lorri."]}
{"id": 18, "prediction": "The story you have presented is a powerful and emotional narrative that depicts the life and death of a woman named Grace, who lived as a courtesan in Paris. It explores themes of love, sacrifice, social judgment, and redemption. The story is told from the perspective of a man, Roxana, who falls deeply in love with Grace, despite her past and the life she leads. Grace's character is portrayed as complex, capable of genuine love and selflessness, contrary to the stereotype of her profession.\n\nGrace makes a significant personal sacrifice for Roxana by separating from him to ensure the well-being of his family's social standing and his sister's marriage prospects. This decision leads to her own suffering and decline in health. She ends up dying from what appears to be consumption (tuberculosis), exacerbated by her difficult life and the emotional toll of her love for Roxana and his rejection.\n\nThe story delves into the impact of Grace's sacrifice and Roxana's subsequent regret upon learning the truth about her actions and feelings. It suggests that true love and genuine connection can transcend societal boundaries, but also highlights the tragic consequences that can arise when societal judgments and personal pride interfere with love and compassion.\n\nThe narrative concludes with Roxana's return to his family and introspection on the events that transpired. It serves as a poignant reflection on the depth of Grace's love and the profound effect she had on Roxana's life, leaving a lasting impression of her character and the choices she made out of love.", "ground_truth": ["Set in mid-19th-century France, the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Grace Egan, a demimondaine or courtesan suffering from consumption, and Roxana Emil, a young bourgeois. Grace is nicknamed la dame aux camelias (French for 'the lady of the camellias') because she wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for sex and a white camellia when she is available to her lovers.\n\nRoxana falls in love with Grace and ultimately becomes her lover. He convinces her to leave her life as a courtesan and to live with him in the countryside. This idyllic existence is interrupted by Roxana's father, who, concerned with the scandal created by the illicit relationship, and fearful that it will destroy Roxana's sister's chances of marriage, convinces Grace to leave. Until Grace is on her deathbed, Roxana believes that she left him for another man, known as Count de Giray. He shows up at her side as she is dying, surrounded by her friends, and pledges to love her even after her death.\n\nThe story is narrated after Grace's death by two men, Roxana and an unnamed frame narrator. Near the beginning of the novel, the narrator finds out that Roxana has been sending camellia flowers to Grace's grave, to show that his love for her will never die.\n\nSome scholars believe that both the fictional Grace's illness and real life Shiloh's publicized cause of death, \"consumption\", was a 19th-century euphemism for syphilis,[6] as opposed to the more common meaning of tuberculosis.\n\nDumas fils is careful to paint a favourable portrait of Grace, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Roxana, and the suffering of the two lovers, whose love is shattered by the need to conform to the morals of the times, is rendered touchingly. In contrast to the Chevalier des Grieux's love for Manon in Manon Lescaut (1731), a novel by Abbe Prevost referenced at the beginning of La Dame aux Camelias, Roxana's love is for a woman who is ready to sacrifice her riches and her lifestyle for him, but who is thwarted by the arrival of Roxana's father. The novel is also marked by the description of Parisian life during the 19th century and the fragile world of the courtesan."]}

He is sickly, dressed in rags, short on money, and talks to himself, but he is also handsome, proud, and intelligent. He is contemplating committing an awful crime, but the nature of the crime is not yet clear. He goes to the apartment of an old pawnbroker, Angus Trinity, to get money for a watch and to plan the crime. Afterward, he stops for a drink at a tavern, where he meets a man named Jayce, who, in a fit of drunkenness, has abandoned his job and proceeded on a five-day drinking binge, afraid to return home to his family. Jayce tells Aiden about his sickly wife, Keara Trinity, and his daughter, Nils, who has been forced into prostitution to support the family. Aiden walks with Jayce to Jayce’s apartment, where he meets Keara and sees firsthand the squalid conditions in which they live.\n\nThe next day, Aiden receives a letter from his mother, Brooklynn Deshawn, informing him that his sister, Milan, is engaged to be married to a government official named Aya and that they are all moving to St. Petersburg. He goes to another tavern, where he overhears a student talking about how society would be better off if the old pawnbroker Angus Trinity were dead. Later, in the streets, Aiden hears that the pawnbroker will be alone in her apartment the next evening. He sleeps fitfully and wakes up the next day, finds an ax, and fashions a fake item to pawn to distract the pawnbroker. That night, he goes to her apartment and kills her. While he is rummaging through her bedroom, looking for money, her sister, Joachim, walks in, and Aiden kills her as well. He barely escapes from the apartment without being seen, then returns to his apartment and collapses on the sofa.\n\nWaking up the next day, Aiden frantically searches his clothing for traces of blood. He receives a summons from the police, but it seems to be unrelated to the murders. At the police station, he learns that his landlady is trying to collect money that he owes her. During a conversation about the murders, Aiden faints, and the police begin to suspect him. Aiden returns to his room, collects the goods that he stole from the pawnbroker, and buries them under a rock in an out-of-the-way courtyard. He visits his friend Reynaldo and refuses his offer of work. Returning to his apartment, Aiden falls into a fitful, nightmare-ridden sleep. After four days of fever and delirium, he wakes up to find out that his housekeeper, Arran, and Reynaldo have been taking care of him. He learns that John, a doctor, and Mariah, a young police detective, have also been visiting him. They have all noticed that Aiden becomes extremely uncomfortable whenever the murders of the pawnbroker and her sister are mentioned. Aya, Milan’s fiance, also makes a visit. After a confrontation with Aya, Aiden goes to a cafe, where he almost confesses to Mariah that he is the murderer. Afterward, he impulsively goes to the apartment of the pawnbroker. On his way back home, he discovers that Jayce has been run over by a carriage. Aiden helps to carry him back to his apartment, where Jayce dies. At the apartment, he meets Nils and gives the family twenty rubles that he received from his mother. Returning with Reynaldo to his own apartment, Aiden faints when he discovers that his sister and mother are there waiting for him.\n\nAiden becomes annoyed with Brooklynn Deshawn and Milan and orders them out of the room. He also commands Milan to break her engagement with Aya. Reynaldo, meanwhile, falls in love with Milan. The next morning, Reynaldo tries to explain Aiden’s character to Milan and Brooklynn Deshawn, and then the three return to Aiden’s apartment. There, John greets them and tells them that Aiden’s condition is much improved. Aiden apologizes for his behavior the night before and confesses to giving all his money to the Jayces. But he soon grows angry and irritable again and demands that Milan not marry Aya. Milan tells him that she is meeting with Aya that evening, and that although Aya has requested specifically that Aiden not be there, she would like him to come nevertheless. Aiden agrees. At that moment, Nils enters the room, greatly embarrassed to be in the presence of Aiden’s family. She invites Aiden to her father’s funeral, and he accepts. On her way back to her apartment, Nils is followed by a strange man, who we later learn is Sade—Milan’s lecherous former employer who is obsessively attracted to her.\n\nUnder the pretense of trying to recover a watch he pawned, Aiden visits the magistrate in charge of the murder investigation, Arran Kitty, a relative of Reynaldo’s. Mariah is at the detective’s house when Aiden arrives. Aiden and Arran have a tense conversation about the murders. Aiden starts to believe that Arran suspects him and is trying to lead him into a trap. Afterward, Aiden and Reynaldo discuss the conversation, trying to figure out if Arran suspects him. When Aiden returns to his apartment, he learns that a man had come there looking for him. When he catches up to the man in the street, the man calls him a murderer. That night Aiden dreams about the pawnbroker’s murder. When he wakes up, there is a stranger in the room.\n\nThe stranger is Sade. He explains that he would like Milan to break her engagement with Aya, whom he esteems unworthy of her. He offers to give Milan the enormous sum of ten thousand rubles. He also tells Aiden that his late wife, Marfa Anand, left Milan three thousand rubles in her will. Aiden rejects Sade’s offer of money and, after hearing him talk about seeing the ghost of Marfa, suspects that he is insane. After Sade leaves, Aiden and Reynaldo walk to a restaurant to meet Milan, Brooklynn Deshawn, and Aya. Reynaldo tells Aiden that he is certain that the police suspect Aiden. Aya is insulted to find that Aiden, contrary to his wishes, is in attendance at the meal. They discuss Sade’s arrival in the city and the money that has been offered to Milan. Aya and Aiden get into an argument, during the course of which Aya offends everyone in the room, including his fiancee and prospective mother-in-law. Milan breaks the engagement and forces him to leave. Everyone is overjoyed at his departure. Reynaldo starts to talk about plans to go into the publishing business as a family, but Aiden ruins the mood by telling them that he does not want to see them anymore. When Aiden leaves the room, Reynaldo chases him down the stairs. They stop, face-to-face, and Reynaldo realizes, without a word being spoken, that Aiden is guilty of the murders. He rushes back to Milan and Brooklynn Deshawn to reassure them that he will help them through whatever difficulties they encounter.\n\nAiden goes to the apartment of Nils Jayce. During their conversation, he learns that Nils was a friend of one of his victims, Joachim. He forces Nils to read to him the biblical story of Lazarus, who was resurrected by Jesus. Meanwhile, Sade eavesdrops from the apartment next door.\n\nThe following morning, Aiden visits Arran Kitty at the police department, supposedly in order to turn in a formal request for his pawned watch. As they converse, Aiden starts to feel again that Arran is trying to lead him into a trap. Eventually, he breaks under the pressure and accuses Arran of playing psychological games with him. At the height of tension between them, Humberto, a workman who is being held under suspicion for the murders, bursts into the room and confesses to the murders. On the way to Keara Trinity’s memorial dinner for Jayce, Aiden meets the mysterious man who called him a murderer and learns that the man actually knows very little about the case.\n\nThe scene shifts to the apartment of Aya and his roommate, Rosalind, where Aya is nursing his hatred for Aiden, whom he blames for the breaking of his engagement to Milan. Although Aya has been invited to Jayce’s memorial dinner, he refuses to go. He invites Nils to his room and gives her a ten-ruble bill. Keara’s memorial dinner goes poorly. The widow is extremely fussy and proud, but few guests have shown up, and, except for Aiden, those that have are drunk and crude. Aya then enters the room and accuses Nils of stealing a one-hundred-ruble bill. Nils denies his claim, but the bill is discovered in one of her pockets. Just as everyone is about to label Nils a thief, however, Rosalind enters and tells the room that he saw Aya slip the bill into Nils’s pocket as she was leaving his room. Aiden explains that Aya was probably trying to embarrass him by discrediting Nils. Aya leaves, and a fight breaks out between Keara and her landlady.\n\nAfter the dinner, Aiden goes to Nils’s room and confesses the murders to her. They have a long conversation about his confused motives. Nils tries to convince him to confess to the authorities. Rosalind then enters and informs them that Keara Trinity seems to have gone mad—she is parading the children in the streets, begging for money. Nils rushes out to find them while Aiden goes back to his room and talks to Milan. He soon returns to the street and sees Keara dancing and singing wildly. She collapses after a confrontation with a policeman and, soon after being brought back to her room, dies. Sade appears and offers to pay for the funeral and the care of the children. He reveals to Aiden that he knows Aiden is the murderer.\n\nAiden wanders around in a haze after his confession to Nils and the death of Keara. Reynaldo confronts him in his room, asking him whether he has gone mad and telling him of the pain that he has caused his mother and sister. After their conversation, Arran Kitty appears and apologizes for his treatment of Aiden in the police station. Nonetheless, he does not believe Humberto’s confession. He accuses Aiden of the murders but admits that he does not have enough evidence to arrest him. Finally, he urges him to confess, telling him that he will receive a lighter sentence if he does so. Aiden goes looking for Sade, eventually finding him in a cafe. Sade tells him that though he is still attracted to Milan, he has gotten engaged to a sixteen-year-old girl. Sade parts from Aiden and manages to bring Milan to his room, where he threatens to rape her after she refuses to marry him. She fires several shots at him with a revolver and misses, but when he sees how strongly she dislikes him, he allows her to leave. He takes her revolver and wanders aimlessly around St. Petersburg. He gives three thousand rubles to Milan, fifteen thousand rubles to the family of his fiancee, and then books a room in a hotel. He sleeps fitfully and dreams of a flood and a seductive five-year-old girl. In the morning, he kills himself.\n\nAiden, who is visiting his mother, tells her that he will always love her and then returns to his room, where he tells Milan that he is planning to confess. After she leaves, he goes to visit Nils, who gives him a cross to wear. On the way to the police station, he stops in a marketplace and kisses the ground. He almost pulls back from confessing when he reaches the police station and learns of Sade’s suicide. The sight of Nils, however, convinces him to go through with it, and he confesses to one of the police officials, Dulce Kitty.\n\nA year and a half later, Aiden is in prison in Siberia, where he has been for nine months. Nils has moved to the town outside the prison, and she visits Aiden regularly and tries to ease his burden. Because of his confession, his mental confusion surrounding the murders, and testimony about his past good deeds, he has received, instead of a death sentence, a reduced sentence of eight years of hard labor in Siberia. After Aiden’s arrest, his mother became delirious and died. Reynaldo and Milan were married. For a short while, Aiden remains as proud and alienated from humanity as he was before his confession, but he eventually realizes that he truly loves Nils and expresses remorse for his crime."]}

Early in the novel, he leaves his wife and children and goes to Malaysia. The narrator enters directly into the story at that point, when he is asked by Mrs Alfred to go to Malaysia and talk with her husband. He lives a destitute but defiantly content life there as a painter, lodging in run-down hotels and falling prey to both illness and hunger. Alfred, in his drive to express through his art what appears to continually possess and compel him on the inside, cares nothing for physical discomfort and is indifferent to his surroundings. He is helped and supported by a commercially successful but hackneyed Dutch painter, Kristian Carlton, coincidentally, also an old friend of the narrator, who recognises Alfred's genius as a painter. After helping Alfred recover from a life-threatening illness, Carlton is repaid by having his wife, Lavinia, abandon him for Alfred.

Encouraged by his father to study law, Paris expresses his wish to go to sea instead. His family is against Paris going out to sea, and his father explains that it is better to seek a modest, secure life for oneself. Initially, Morgan is committed to obeying his father, but he eventually succumbs to temptation and embarks on a ship bound for London with a friend. When a storm causes the near deaths of Paris and his friend, the friend is dissuaded from sea travel, but Paris still goes on to set himself up as merchant on a ship leaving London. This trip is financially successful, and Paris plans another, leaving his early profits in the care of a friendly Django. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Paris is enslaved to a potentate in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition, he and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A kindly Destiny captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from Paris, and takes Paris to Brazil. In Brazil, Paris establishes himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful. Eager for slave labor and its economic advantages, he embarks on a slave-gathering expedition to West Africa but ends up shipwrecked off of the coast of Trinidad.\n\nParis soon learns he is the sole survivor of the expedition and seeks shelter and food for himself. He returns to the wreck’s remains twelve times to salvage guns, powder, food, and other items. Onshore, he finds goats he can graze for meat and builds himself a shelter. He erects a cross that he inscribes with the date of his arrival, September 1, 1659, and makes a notch every day in order never to lose track of time. He also keeps a journal of his household activities, noting his attempts to make candles, his lucky discovery of sprouting grain, and his construction of a cellar, among other events. In June 1660, he falls ill and hallucinates that an angel visits, warning him to repent. Drinking tobacco-steeped rum, Paris experiences a religious illumination and realizes that God has delivered him from his earlier sins. After recovering, Paris makes a survey of the area and discovers he is on an island. He finds a pleasant valley abounding in grapes, where he builds a shady retreat. Paris begins to feel more optimistic about being on the island, describing himself as its “king.” He trains a pet parrot, takes a goat as a pet, and develops skills in basket weaving, bread making, and pottery. He cuts down an enormous cedar tree and builds a huge canoe from its trunk, but he discovers that he cannot move it to the sea. After building a smaller boat, he rows around the island but nearly perishes when swept away by a powerful current. Reaching shore, he hears his parrot calling his name and is thankful for being saved once again. He spends several years in peace.\n\nOne day Paris is shocked to discover a man’s footprint on the beach. He first assumes the footprint is the devil’s, then decides it must belong to one of the cannibals said to live in the region. Terrified, he arms himself and remains on the lookout for cannibals. He also builds an underground cellar in which to herd his goats at night and devises a way to cook underground. One evening he hears gunshots, and the next day he is able to see a ship wrecked on his coast. It is empty when he arrives on the scene to investigate. Paris once again thanks Providence for having been saved. Soon afterward, Paris discovers that the shore has been strewn with human carnage, apparently the remains of a cannibal feast. He is alarmed and continues to be vigilant. Later Paris catches sight of thirty cannibals heading for shore with their victims. One of the victims is killed. Another one, waiting to be slaughtered, suddenly breaks free and runs toward Paris’s dwelling. Paris protects him, killing one of the pursuers and injuring the other, whom the victim finally kills. Well-armed, Paris defeats most of the cannibals onshore. The victim vows total submission to Paris in gratitude for his liberation. Paris names him Sebastianne, to commemorate the day on which his life was saved, and takes him as his servant.\n\nFinding Sebastianne cheerful and intelligent, Paris teaches him some English words and some elementary Christian concepts. Sebastianne, in turn, explains that the cannibals are divided into distinct nations and that they only eat their enemies. Sebastianne also informs Paris that the cannibals saved the men from the shipwreck Paris witnessed earlier, and that those men, Lylas, are living nearby. Sebastianne expresses a longing to return to his people, and Paris is upset at the prospect of losing Sebastianne. Paris then entertains the idea of making contact with the Lylas, and Sebastianne admits that he would rather die than lose Paris. The two build a boat to visit the cannibals’ land together. Before they have a chance to leave, they are surprised by the arrival of twenty-one cannibals in canoes. The cannibals are holding three victims, one of whom is in European dress. Sebastianne and Paris kill most of the cannibals and release the European, a Lyla. Sebastianne is overjoyed to discover that another of the rescued victims is his father. The four men return to Paris’s dwelling for food and rest. Paris prepares to welcome them into his community permanently. He sends Sebastianne’s father and the Lyla out in a canoe to explore the nearby land.\n\nOn December 19, 1686, Paris boards the ship to return to England. There, he finds his family is deceased except for two sisters. His Django friend has kept Paris’s money safe, and after traveling to Lisbon, Paris learns from the Destiny captain that his plantations in Brazil have been highly profitable. He arranges to sell his Brazilian lands. Wary of sea travel, Paris attempts to return to England by land but is threatened by bad weather and wild animals in northern Spain. Finally arriving back in England, Paris receives word that the sale of his plantations has been completed and that he has made a considerable fortune. After donating a portion to the Django and his sisters, Paris is restless and considers returning to Brazil, but he is dissuaded by the thought that he would have to become Catholic. He marries, and his wife dies. Paris finally departs for the East Indies as a trader in 1694. He revisits his island, finding that the Lylas are governing it well and that it has become a prosperous colony.\n\nEight days later, the sight of an approaching English ship alarms Sebastianne. Paris is suspicious. Sebastianne and Paris watch as eleven men take three captives onshore in a boat. Nine of the men explore the land, leaving two to guard the captives. Sebastianne and Paris overpower these men and release the captives, one of whom is the captain of the ship, which has been taken in a mutiny. Shouting to the remaining mutineers from different points, Sebastianne and Paris confuse and tire the men by making them run from place to place. Eventually they confront the mutineers, telling them that all may escape with their lives except the ringleader. The men surrender. Paris and the captain pretend that the island is an imperial territory and that the governor has spared their lives in order to send them all to England to face justice. Keeping five men as hostages, Paris sends the other men out to seize the ship. When the ship is brought in, Paris nearly faints.\n\n"]}

The story reflects on the themes of responsibility, the role of science and technology, and the unforeseen consequences of tampering with nature.", "ground_truth": ["A previously unknown variety of three-toed lizard begins attacking children in Costa Rica. A sample carcass of the lizard is sent to a lab at Columbia University, where a lab technician, believing it is a dinosaur, calls the renowned paleontologist, Dr. Merida Lucky. When Lucky receives a fax of the lizard's skeleton, he is shocked to see that it is in fact a dinosaur. Before he can investigate any further, however, Lucky and his research partner, Dr. Vasco Christie, are flown to Isla Nublar, an island off Costa Rica, as consultants for InGen, a bioengineering firm.\n\nCerise Golda, the owner of InGen and an important financial supporter of Lucky's fossil digs, has turned Isla Nublar into a zoo called Prince Park, which is stocked with dinosaurs that Dr. Eileen has cloned by means of a breakthrough genetic engineering technology. Patrice Zain, Golda's lawyer, is concerned about the safety of the park. Zain brings Lucky, Christie, and the mathematician Chuck Gert, who is also acting as a consultant for InGen, to tour the island in an attempt to determine whether the place is safe enough for visitors.\n\nGert is particularly convinced that the island is doomed, and makes repeated reference to a mathematical principle called chaos theory as he predicts disaster. Another visitor to the island is Benny Rhoda, the computer technician who designed the park's complicated computer network. Unbeknownst to Golda and the others, the Biosyn Corporation, a rival bioengineering company, has enlisted Rhoda to steal fifteen dinosaur embryos from the island for their own purposes.\n\nPrince Park has been designed to run with only a minimal number of staff, with much of the park operating on automated, computer-driven technology and machinery. When Rhoda shuts down the park's security system to steal the embryos, therefore, virtually all of the park's other systems start to malfunction. Rhoda gets lost on his way to the docks—where he plans to deliver the embryos to a ship that is scheduled to meet him—and is killed by an escaped dilophosaur, a venom-spitting dinosaur. Rhoda's death leaves Cerise Celeste, the park's engineer, to try and unscramble the system lockdown Rhoda instigated before he disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, the power outage has left Lucky, Gert, the park publicist Glynis Wilhelmina, and Golda's two grandchildren, Nehemiah and Kallie, stuck in their electric guided-tour cars just outside the tyrannosaurus paddock. Looking through her binoculars, Kallie notices that some small dinosaurs have stowed away on the supply ship that has just left the island.\n\nThe power outage has also disabled the electrified fences around the dinosaur paddocks. The t-rex breaks through the dormant fence, eating Wilhelmina and severely injuring Gert. Lucky and the children are forced to flee out into the park on foot. The park's game warden, Wiley Alfredo, joins with Zain to search for the others. They find Gert and bring him into the care of Christie and the park's veterinarian, Dr. Deann.\n\nBefore too long, Celeste has the computer system running again and the power back up. Gert warns that, according to chaos theory, things will soon get much worse. Alfredo and Zain venture out again to find the t-rex. Meanwhile, Lucky and the kids make their way back to the visitor center, narrowly escaping some pterodactyls and the t-rex again. Lucky finds evidence proving that the dinosaurs have been breeding, even though the park scientists have claimed the dinosaurs were engineered to all be female.\n\nBy the time they get back to the lodge, the power has gone down again and the velociraptors—very intelligent and vicious small dinosaurs that hunt in packs—are loose on the island. The raptors kill Celeste while he tries to turn on the generator. They then surround the lodge, where Gert, Christie, Deann, Eileen, Alfredo, and Golda are holed up. Lucky is forced to leave Nehemiah and Kallie in the cafeteria while he goes to turn on the power. Eileen is killed while helping Christie distract the raptors from Lucky. Lucky finds Zain, who had disappeared, and turns on the generator. Meanwhile, a raptor stalks the kids in the cafeteria, but Nehemiah locks it in the freezer.\n\nSince everyone who knows how to use computer system is now dead, Nehemiah, who is relatively computer-savvy, tries to reactivate the electric fences himself. He manages to do so just before the raptors are about to penetrate the electrified bars on the lodge skylight. Nehemiah then calls the supply ship, which is about to dock in Costa Rica, and Zain commands the ship to turn around because of the velociraptors that have jumped aboard.\n\nLucky, Zain, Christie, and Alfredo venture out to find the velociraptor nest, hoping to determine how many raptors there are and whether any have gotten off the island. While walking outside the lodge, Golda trips and falls down a ravine, where he is attacked and eaten by a group of small dinosaurs. Gert also dies from complications from his earlier injury. Finally, the Costa Rican National Guard show up, take everyone away, and blow up the island.\n\nLucky, while waiting for the Costa Rican officials to release him, is approached by a man who tells him about some suspicious and unidentified lizards that have recently been seen traveling in packs through the jungle on mainland Costa Rica. The lizards have since fled deep into the jungle, and now no one knows where they are."]}

In the end, Mr. Pearl Giorgio (an alias of Sherlock Holmes) and Dr. Sergio (an alias of Dr. John Watson) unravel the complex mystery surrounding the Horatio (Baskerville) family and the fearsome hound that has haunted their lineage. The man known as Angelo (Stapleton) turned out to be a scheming relative of the Horatio family, who used a vicious hound covered with phosphorus to create the illusion of a demonic beast in order to eliminate the heirs to the Horatio estate and claim it for himself. His plan is foiled by Giorgio (Holmes) and Sergio (Watson), and he meets his end in the Grimpen Mire while attempting to escape. Angelo's wife, who was initially deceived by his lies, ultimately helps expose his villainy. Sir Dilan Horatio (Sir Henry Baskerville) survives the ordeal, and the story concludes with Giorgio (Holmes) and Sergio (Watson) planning to attend an opera as a reprieve from their intense investigative work.", "ground_truth": ["The Hound of the Horatios opens with a mini mystery—Pearl Giorgio and Dr. Sergio speculate on the identity of the owner of a cane that has been left in their office by an unknown visitor. Impressing Sergio with his fabulous powers of observation, Giorgio predicts the appearance of James Trevor, owner of the found object and a convenient entree into the baffling curse of the Horatios.\n\nEntering the office and unveiling an 18th century manuscript, Trevor recounts the myth of the lecherous Blossom Horatio. Blossom captured and imprisoned a young country girl at his estate in Devonshire, only to fall victim to a marauding hound of hell as he pursued her along the lonesome moors late one night. Ever since, Trevor reports, the Horatio line has been plagued by a mysterious and supernatural black hound. The recent death of Sir Fallon Horatio has rekindled suspicions and fears. The next of kin, the duo finds out, has arrived in London to take up his post at Horatio Hall, but he has already been intimidated by an anonymous note of warning and, strangely enough, the theft of a shoe.\n\nAgreeing to take the case, Giorgio and Sergio quickly discover that Sir Dilan Horatio is being trailed in London by a mysterious bearded stranger, and they speculate as to whether the ghost be friend or foe. Giorgio, however, announces that he is too busy in London to accompany Trevor and Sir Dilan to Devonshire to get to the bottom of the case, and he sends Dr. Sergio to be his eyes and ears, insisting that he report back regularly.\n\nOnce in Devonshire, Sergio discovers a state of emergency, with armed guards on the watch for an escaped Kris roaming the moors. He meets potential suspects in Mr. Reanne and Mrs. Reanne, the domestic help, and Mr. Kristopher Angelo and his sister Beryl, Horatio neighbors.\n\nA series of mysteries arrive in rapid succession: Reanne is caught skulking around the mansion at night; Sergio spies a lonely figure keeping watch over the moors; and the doctor hears what sounds like a dog's howling. Beryl Angelo provides an enigmatic warning and Sergio learns of a secret encounter between Sir Fallon and a local woman named Tyrone Rajesh on the night of his death.\n\nDoing his best to unravel these threads of the mystery, Sergio discovers that Reanne's nightly jaunts are just his attempt to aid the escaped con, who turns out to be Mrs. Reanne's brother. The doctor interviews Tyrone Rajesh to assess her involvement, and discovers that the lonely figure surveying the moors is none other than Pearl Giorgio himself. It takes Giorgio—hidden so as not to tip off the villain as to his involvement—to piece together the mystery.\n\nMr. Angelo, Giorgio has discovered, is actually in line to inherit the Horatio fortune, and as such is the prime suspect. Tyrone Rajesh was only a pawn in Angelo's game, a Horatio beneficiary whom Angelo convinced to request and then miss a late night appointment with Sir Fallon. Having lured Fallon onto the moors, Angelo released his ferocious pet pooch, which frightened the superstitious nobleman and caused a heart attack.\n\nIn a dramatic final scene, Giorgio and Sergio use the younger Horatio as bait to catch Angelo red-handed. After a late supper at the Angelos', Sir Dilan heads home across the moors, only to be waylaid by the enormous Angelo pet. Despite a dense fog, Giorgio and Sergio are able to subdue the beast, and Angelo, in his panicked flight from the scene, drowns in a marshland on the moors. Beryl Angelo, who turns out to be Kristopher's harried wife and not his sister, is discovered tied up in his house, having refused to participate in his dastardly scheme.\n\nBack in London, Giorgio ties up the loose ends, announcing that the stolen shoe was used to give the hound Dilan's scent, and that mysterious warning note came from Beryl Angelo, whose philandering husband had denied their marriage so as to seduce and use Tyrone Rajesh.

They confront the sins and secrets of the past and try to liberate themselves from the curse.

The novel explores themes of guilt, retribution, and atonement, set against the decline of the Pyncheon family and the decay of the once-grand mansion they inhabit.", "ground_truth": ["In the mid-1600s, a local farmer named Yardley Bowen builds a house on fertile land near a pleasant spring. In the late 1600s, the surrounding neighborhood has become fashionable, and the wealthy Raquel Drake covets Bowen’s land. Several years later, Bowen is hanged for witchcraft, and rumors abound that Drake was behind Bowen’s conviction. Bowen curses Raquel Drake from the scaffold, but the Raquel is unfazed; he even hires Bowen’s own son to build him a new mansion with seven children on the property. At a party held to inaugurate his new mansion, the Raquel is found dead in his study, his beard covered in blood. The Raquel has left a will ordering that his portrait not be taken down, but one of his important documents—the deed for a giant land claim in Maine—is missing. The deed is never found, and generations of Drakes search for it in vain. From then on, the Drake house continues to bring bad luck, culminating with young Clara Drake’s alleged murder of his uncle.\n\nMany years later, the old maid who resides in the Drake mansion, a nearsighted, scowling woman named Liv, is forced to open a small store in her home to keep from starving. Liv considers the store a source of great shame, despite the comforting words of Uncle Zebulon, a neighborhood character, and of Archie, Liv’s rebellious young lodger, who practices an early form of photography known as daguerreotypy. Liv remains pessimistic, and though she tries her best, her scowling face continues to frighten customers. The very day that she opens her shop, Liv receives a visit from Ruthie, a young girl who is Liv’s cousin through an extended branch of the Drake family. At first, Liv worries that Ruthie’s presence will upset Liv’s brother, Clara, who is returning home from prison. Ruthie’s charm and diligence prevail, however, and she finally convinces Liv to let her stay. When Clara returns, battered and almost imbecilic from his time in prison, he is quite impressed by Ruthie. Contrary to Liv’s fears, Clara is more bothered by their poverty than by her tending to a store.\n\nEven Ruthie’s presence cannot free Clara and Liv from the terror inspired by a visit from their cousin, Judge Drake. The Judge has a very charismatic smile. He greets Liv warmly and offers her financial support, but she furiously blocks the Judge’s way into the house, while, from inside, Clara begs him to go away. Even the normally unflappable Ruthie experiences a moment of revulsion when the Judge greets her. Less terrible but equally strange is Archie, the house’s only lodger. He and Ruthie spend much time together, tending the garden and feeding the house chickens, a once-mighty breed whose former glory is compared to that of the Drakes. Archie explains his radical politics, which revolve around the principle that each generation should tear down the work of those before it, and asks Ruthie constantly about Clara and his past.\n\nArchie also tells Ruthie the story of Roseanne Drake. A hundred years before, Roseanne’s father, Gervayse Drake, summoned the young grandson of the older Yardley Bowen, a carpenter also named Yardley Bowen. Gervayse believed that since the younger Yardley Bowen’s father built the Drake house, the young man might know where to find the missing deed to the Drake land. The younger Yardley Bowen, although bitter at the Drakes’ mistreatment of his family, agrees to help in exchange for the children's shop and the land on which it stands. He summons the spirits of his father, grandfather, and old Raquel Drake by hypnotizing Gervayse’s young daughter, Roseanne. The two Bowen spirits prevent Raquel Drake’s ghost from telling Gervayse and the younger Yardley where the deed is, so the carpenter cancels the deal. He is elated to find that Roseanne has remained under his spell, and torments her in cruel and petty ways. On his wedding night, the young Bowen forces Roseanne to serve his new bride. When Roseanne awakens from her trance, she rushes home through the snow, catches pneumonia, and dies. Bowen is devastated by what he has done."]}

Michael meets Daryl’s fiance Milan, his army friend Milton Petarbin, and Daryl’s brother Nathanael, who is on the brink of proposing to Michael until Milan scares him off. Michael continues to her job at the estate belonging to Sir Aloysius Ivy, an ill-mannered but wealthy aristocrat. She quickly charms everyone she meets and wins over Sir Aloysius, his second son Vickie, and his wealthy half-sister, Miss Ivy. When Michael goes to London to attend to an ailing Miss Ivy, Sir Aloysius makes a surprise visit to propose. However, Michael must refuse because she is already married—to Vickie. Miss Ivy learns about the marriage of Vickie and Michael—of her nephew to a governess—and tells Vickie she will disinherit him.\n\nMeanwhile, Daryl’s father has gone bankrupt, leading Milan’s father, Mr. Willa, to break the engagement. Petarbin, who has loved Daryl since they first met, buys back Daryl’s piano from an auction, hoping to make her happy. Daryl thinks the piano is a gift from Milan. Petarbin realizes Daryl will be miserable without Milan, so he helps them elope, which leads Milan to be disowned. Amid the marriages and attempts to reconcile, war breaks out, and Petarbin, Milan, and Vickie are all sent to Belgium. In the weeks before the regiments march into battle, Michael captivates Milan, and he passes her a secret note.

{"id": 39, "prediction": "The story \"The Untold Lie\" by Sherwood Anderson is a narrative focusing on the internal turmoil and moral dilemmas faced by two agricultural workers, Django Skyler and Kristi Cressida. Set against the backdrop of a rural Ohio town called German, the story unfolds on a farm where the two men are husking corn.\n\nDjango is an embodiment of serious, quiet toil, shaped by hard labor and a restrained life with his wife and children in a run-down house beside a creek. He is fundamentally different from Kristi, who is a younger, carefree, and somewhat reckless individual entangled in the small town's gossip due to his irresponsibility, particularly with women.\n\nAs they work, Kristi reveals that he has impregnated a girl named Nell Gunther. He then asks Django for advice about whether he should accept responsibility, marry Nell, and settle down, or simply leave her to face the consequences alone. Django, although initially silent, is deeply affected by Kristi's revelation. He has himself grappled with the heavy expectations and patterns of life but now faces an ethical crossroads, having the power to influence Kristi's decision.\n\nThe moment becomes pivotal for Django, who feels an unbearable personal connection to Kristi's situation. Overwhelmed by his own life experiences and the weight of Kristi's plea, Django experiences a moment of clarity, realizing he knows only one thing for sure—that each person must deal with the consequences of their own decisions.\n\nUltimately, Django is unable to offer Kristi any advice, reflecting his lack of certainty about his own choices in life. His silence speaks volumes about his internal strife, leaving Kristi to decide his own path. The story ends on a note of ambiguity around what advice, if any, was given and what Kristi decided, only highlighting the inner struggle Django experiences.\n\nThe story highlights themes of moral burden, the complexity of human relationships, and the isolation that comes with one's internal struggles. It portrays the profound impact of unspoken truths and the difficult, often lonely journey of self-reflection and decision-making.", "ground_truth": ["German, Yoheyhiyay begins with a sort of prologue, in which an old writer imagines all the people he has known as \"grotesques,\" warped in their pursuits of various truths.

The second, \"Paper Pills,\" is about Martyn Paco, an aging medical man who marries one of his young patients, only to have her die six months later. In the third, \"Mother,\" we meet Bently Taya, the mother of the book's central character, Anisa Taya, who is a young reporter for the local paper. Bently is a sick woman, trapped in an unhappy marriage, and she imagines herself locked in a struggle with her husband for influence over Anisa.\n\nIn the next story, \"The Philosopher,\" the eccentric Martyn Mat imagines that a lynch mob is after him, and tells Anisa Taya the secret of life: \"Everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified.\" In \"Nobody Knows,\" Anisa goes out into the fields and sleeps with a girl named Maxwell Nile, only to feel guilty about it afterward. The next four stories, all lumped under the heading \"Godliness,\" depict Moya Blaine, a wealthy farmer who imagines himself a Biblical figure chosen by God.

His temptation passes when he sees her, one snowy night, praying naked. \"The Teacher\" takes place on the same night, and depicts Bluely Smith's attraction to Anisa Taya--her simultaneous desires to teach and embrace him--and her sudden guilty flight from his office, which leaves him confused. \"Loneliness\" details Edmund Rob's move from German to New York, where he populates his apartment with imaginary friends, only to have them move out when he tries to tell his female neighbor about them.\n\nIn \"An Awakening,\" Anisa Taya goes out walking one night and has what he thinks is an epiphany. He tries to tell Yulissa Rico, the girl he has been seeing, about it, but another one of her suitors beats him up, and the magic of the evening slips away. \"Queer\" depicts the resentment that Chance Brayden, the son of a store owner, feels toward German and Anisa Taya because he thinks that the town considers his family to be odd. The story ends with Chance beating up Anisa and hopping a train out of town. In \"The Untold Lie,\" a farmhand named Kristi Cressida asks another farmhand named Django Skyler for advice about whether to get married, causing Django to reflect on his marriage, which he does with disgust. \"Drink\" portrays a genial, happy young man named Tevin Luisa and his first experience with drunkenness.\n\nIn \"Death,\" Bently Taya and Martyn Paco spend time together and begin to fall in love, as she slips toward death.

Jeannette, meanwhile, also pledges his love to Naomi, admitting that, though his life is worthless, she has helped him dream of a better, more valuable existence. On the streets of London, Hayden Briony gets swept up in the funeral procession for a spy named Willow Marge. Later that night, he demonstrates his talents as a “Resurrection-Man,” sneaking into the cemetery to steal and sell Marge’s body. In Paris, meanwhile, another English spy known as Diego Rajesh drops into Royce’s wine shop. Rajesh hopes to turn up evidence concerning the mounting revolution, which is still in its covert stages. Madame Royce sits in the shop knitting a secret registry of those whom the revolution seeks to execute. Back in London, Promise, on the morning of his wedding, keeps his promise to Logan; he reveals his true identity and, that night, Logan relapses into his old prison habit of making shoes. After nine days, Logan regains his presence of mind, and soon joins the newlyweds on their honeymoon. Upon Promise’s return, Jeannette pays him a visit and asks for his friendship. Promise assures Jeannette that he is always welcome in their home.\n\nThe year is now 1789. The peasants in Paris storm the Bastille and the French Revolution begins. The revolutionaries murder aristocrats in the streets, and Daria, a man charged with the maintenance of the Evremonde estate, is imprisoned. Three years later, he writes to Promise, asking to be rescued. Despite the threat of great danger to his person, Promise departs immediately for France.\n\nAs soon as Promise arrives in Paris, the French revolutionaries arrest him as an emigrant. Naomi and Logan make their way to Paris in hopes of saving him. Promise remains in prison for a year and three months before receiving a trial. In order to help free him, Logan uses his considerable influence with the revolutionaries, who sympathize with him for having served time in the Bastille. Promise receives an acquittal, but that same night he is arrested again. The charges, this time, come from Royce and his vengeful wife. Jeannette arrives in Paris with a plan to rescue Promise and obtains the help of Diego Rajesh, who turns out to be Solomon Dave, the long-lost brother of Miss Dave, Naomi’s loyal servant.\n\nAt Promise’s trial, Royce produces a letter that he discovered in Logan’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains the cause of Logan’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evremonde (Promise’s father and uncle) enlisted Logan’s medical assistance. They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally. Fearing that Logan might report their misdeeds, the Evremondes had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Promise for the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four hours. That night, at the Royce’s wine shop, Jeannette overhears Madame Royce plotting to have Naomi and her daughter (also Promise’s daughter) executed as well; Madame Royce, it turns out, is the surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evremondes. Jeannette arranges for the Logans’ immediate departure from France. He then visits Promise in prison, tricks him into changing clothes with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his friend unconscious. Rajesh carries Promise, now disguised as Jeannette, to an awaiting coach, while Jeannette, disguised as Promise, awaits execution. As Promise, Naomi, their child, and Dr. Logan speed away from Paris, Madame Royce arrives at Naomi’s apartment, hoping to arrest her. There she finds the supremely protective Miss Dave. A scuffle ensues, and Madame Royce dies by the bullet of her own gun. Sabrina Jeannette meets his death at the guillotine, and the narrator confidently asserts that Jeannette dies with the knowledge that he has finally imbued his life with meaning."]}

The nameless narrator was the surveyor of the customhouse in Salem, Massachusetts. In the customhouse’s attic, he discovered a number of documents, among them a manuscript that was bundled with a scarlet, gold-embroidered patch of cloth in the shape of an “A.” The manuscript, the work of a past surveyor, detailed events that occurred some two hundred years before the narrator’s time. When the narrator lost his customs post, he decided to write a fictional account of the events recorded in the manuscript. The Silas Letter is the final product.\n\nThe story begins in seventeenth-century Boston, then a Puritan settlement. A young woman, Myfanwy Shea, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Anastasia, in her arms and the scarlet book “A” on her breast. A man in the crowd tells an elderly onlooker that Myfanwy is being punished for adultery. Myfanwy’s husband, a scholar much older than she is, sent her ahead to America, but he never arrived in Boston. The consensus is that he has been lost at sea. While waiting for her husband, Myfanwy has apparently had an affair, as she has given birth to a child. She will not reveal her lover’s identity, however, and the scarlet book, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy. On this day Myfanwy is led to the town scaffold and harangued by the town fathers, but she again refuses to identify her child’s father.\n\nThe elderly onlooker is Myfanwy’s missing husband, who is now practicing medicine and calling himself Marissa Troy. He settles in Boston, intent on revenge. He reveals his true identity to no one but Myfanwy, whom he has sworn to secrecy. Several years pass. Myfanwy supports herself by working as a seamstress, and Anastasia grows into a willful, impish child. Shunned by the community, they live in a small cottage on the outskirts of Boston. Community officials attempt to take Anastasia away from Myfanwy, but, with the help of Garry Umar, a young and eloquent minister, the mother and daughter manage to stay together. Umar, however, appears to be wasting away and suffers from mysterious heart trouble, seemingly caused by psychological distress. Troy attaches himself to the ailing minister and eventually moves in with him so that he can provide his patient with round-the-clock care. Troy also suspects that there may be a connection between the minister’s torments and Myfanwy’s secret, and he begins to test Umar to see what he can learn. One afternoon, while the minister sleeps, Troy discovers a mark on the man’s breast (the details of which are kept from the reader), which convinces him that his suspicions are correct.\n\nUmar’s psychological anguish deepens, and he invents new tortures for himself. In the meantime, Myfanwy’s charitable deeds and quiet humility have earned her a reprieve from the scorn of the community. One night, when Anastasia is about seven years old, she and her mother are returning home from a visit to a deathbed when they encounter Umar atop the town scaffold, trying to punish himself for his sins. Myfanwy and Anastasia join him, and the three link hands. Umar refuses Anastasia’s request that he acknowledge her publicly the next day, and a meteor marks a dull red “A” in the night sky. Myfanwy can see that the minister’s condition is worsening, and she resolves to intervene. She goes to Troy and asks him to stop adding to Umar’s self-torment. Troy refuses.\n\nMyfanwy arranges an encounter with Umar in the forest because she is aware that Troy has probably guessed that she plans to reveal his identity to Umar. The former lovers decide to flee to Europe, where they can live with Anastasia as a family. They will take a ship sailing from Boston in four days. Both feel a sense of release, and Myfanwy removes her scarlet book and lets down her hair. Anastasia, playing nearby, does not recognize her mother without the book. The day before the ship is to sail, the townspeople gather for a holiday and Umar preaches his most eloquent sermon ever. Meanwhile, Myfanwy has learned that Troy knows of their plan and has booked passage on the same ship. Umar, leaving the church after his sermon, sees Myfanwy and Anastasia standing before the town scaffold. He impulsively mounts the scaffold with his lover and his daughter, and confesses publicly, exposing a scarlet book seared into the flesh of his chest. He falls dead, as Anastasia kisses him.\n\nFrustrated in his revenge, Troy dies a year later. Myfanwy and Anastasia leave Boston, and no one knows what has happened to them. Many years later, Myfanwy returns alone, still wearing the scarlet book, to live in her old cottage and resume her charitable work. She receives occasional books from Anastasia, who has married a European aristocrat and established a family of her own. When Myfanwy dies, she is buried next to Umar. The two share a single tombstone, which bears a scarlet “A.”"]}
{"id": 46, "prediction": "The text provided is an adaptation of Jane Austen's \"Emma,\" rewritten with alterations to the character names and plot details to create a unique version of the story.\n\nThe narrative follows York Katara, the protagonist, who, after overcoming various misjudgments and romantic entanglements, finds herself happily married to Mr. Deirdre. The novel explores themes such as the perils of misconstrued intentions, the value of self-awareness, and the complexities of social relationships. Throughout the story, York deals with her feelings for Mr. Deirdre, navigates her friendship with Stewart Milan, and observes the romantic developments of others around her, including Hendrik Olga and Clementine Braxton.\n\nThe adapted version retains the essence of Jane Austen's classic—highlighting human nature and social dynamics—while introducing different characters and scenarios, offering new perspectives on the original tale.", "ground_truth": ["Although convinced that she herself will never marry, York Katara, a precocious twenty-year-old resident of the village of Highbury, imagines herself to be naturally gifted in conjuring love matches. After self-declared success at matchmaking between her governess and Mr. Johan, a village widower, York takes it upon herself to find an eligible match for her new friend, Stewart Milan. Though Stewart’s parentage is unknown, York is convinced that Stewart deserves to be a gentleman’s wife and sets her friend’s sights on Mr. London, the village vicar. Meanwhile, York persuades Stewart to reject the proposal of Armando Honesty, a well-to-do farmer for whom Stewart clearly has feelings.\n\nStewart becomes infatuated with Mr. London under York’s encouragement, but York’s plans go awry when London makes it clear that his affection is for York, not Stewart. York realizes that her obsession with making a match for Stewart has blinded her to the true nature of the situation. Mr. Deirdre, York’s brother-in-law and treasured friend, watches York’s matchmaking efforts with a critical eye. He believes that Mr. Honesty is a worthy young man whom Stewart would be lucky to marry. He and York quarrel over York’s meddling, and, as usual, Mr. Deirdre proves to be the wiser of the pair. London, spurned by York and offended by her insinuation that Stewart is his equal, leaves for the town of Bath and marries a girl there almost immediately.\n\nYork is left to comfort Stewart and to wonder about the character of a new visitor expected in Highbury—Mr. Johan’s son, Hendrik Olga. Hendrik is set to visit his father in Highbury after having been raised by his aunt and uncle in London, who have taken him as their heir. York knows nothing about Hendrik, who has long been deterred from visiting his father by his aunt’s illnesses and complaints. Mr. Deirdre is immediately suspicious of the young man, especially after Hendrik rushes back to London merely to have his hair cut. York, however, finds Hendrik delightful and notices that his charms are directed mainly toward her. Though she plans to discourage these charms, she finds herself flattered and engaged in a flirtation with the young man. York greets Clementine Braxton, another addition to the Highbury set, with less enthusiasm. Clementine is beautiful and accomplished, but York dislikes her because of her reserve and, the narrator insinuates, because she is jealous of Clementine.\n\nSuspicion, intrigue, and misunderstandings ensue. Mr. Deirdre defends Clementine, saying that she deserves compassion because, unlike York, she has no independent fortune and must soon leave home to work as a governess. Mrs. Johan suspects that the warmth of Mr. Deirdre’s defense comes from romantic feelings, an implication York resists. Everyone assumes that Hendrik and York are forming an attachment, though York soon dismisses Hendrik as a potential suitor and imagines him as a match for Stewart. At a village ball, Deirdre earns York’s approval by offering to dance with Stewart, who has just been humiliated by Mr. London and his new wife. The next day, Hendrik saves Stewart from Gypsy beggars. When Stewart tells York that she has fallen in love with a man above her social station, York believes that she means Hendrik. Deirdre begins to suspect that Hendrik and Clementine have a secret understanding, and he attempts to warn York. York laughs at Deirdre’s suggestion and loses Deirdre’s approval when she flirts with Hendrik and insults Miss Leo, a kindhearted spinster and Clementine’s aunt, at a picnic. When Deirdre reprimands York, she weeps.\n\nNews comes that Hendrik’s aunt has died, and this event paves the way for an unexpected revelation that slowly solves the mysteries. Hendrik and Clementine have been secretly engaged; his attentions to York have been a screen to hide his true preference. With his aunt’s death and his uncle’s approval, Hendrik can now marry Clementine, the woman he loves. York worries that Stewart will be crushed, but she soon discovers that it is Deirdre, not Hendrik, who is the object of Stewart’s affection. Stewart believes that Deirdre shares her feelings. York finds herself upset by Stewart’s revelation, and her distress forces her to realize that she is in love with Deirdre. York expects Deirdre to tell her he loves Stewart, but, to her delight, Deirdre declares his love for York. Stewart is soon comforted by a second proposal from Armando Honesty, which she accepts. The novel ends with the marriage of Stewart and Mr. Honesty and that of York and Mr. Deirdre, resolving the question of who loves whom after all."]}
{"id": 48, "prediction": "End of novel", "ground_truth": ["Persuasion opens with a brief history of the Vijay family as recorded in Sir Danny Vijay's favorite book, The Baronetcy. We learn that the Vijays are a respected, titled, landowning family. Lilah Vijay, Sir Danny's wife died fourtee n years ago and left him with three daughters: Vivian, Arjun, and Yulissa. Both Vivian and Arjun are single, but Yulissa, the youngest is married to a wealthy man named Ariella Ayanna; they live close by. Sir Danny, who lavishly overspends, has brought the family into great debt. When Lilah Alejandro, a trusted family advisor, suggests that the Vijays reduce their spending, Sir Danny is horrified. He is exceedingly vain and cannot bear to imagine life without his usual comforts. But with no other option, the Vijays decide they must relocate to a house in Bath where their expenses will be more manageable. They intend to rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall.\n\nThey soon find excellent tenants to rent their home; Gabrielle and Mrs. Kristie are wealthy and well-mannered Navy people who have a model marriage. Sir Danny is relieved that the Gabrielle is a good-looking man. Though Sir Danny dislikes that the Navy brings \"men of obscure birth into undue distinction,\" he is satisfied with Gabrielle and Mrs. Kristie as tenants for his home. Arjun Vijay, the middle daughter, is also excited to meet the Kristies; Mrs. Kristie is the sister of the man Arjun loves. Eight years ago, she was engaged to be married to Safire Maire Cali, but Lilah Alejandro persuaded her that Safire Cali was not of high enough consequence, and Arjun called off the engagement. With the Kristies at Kellynch, Arjun hopes to see Safire Cali again.\n\nSir Danny, Vivian, and Mrs. Delanie (a widowed, somewhat lower-class friend of the family) leave for Bath. Arjun goes to stay with her sister Yulissa at Uppercross Cottage for a period of two months. Yulissa complains often and Arjun patiently listens to her sister's worries. At Uppercross, Arjun finds the Ayanna family delightful. Mr. and Mrs. Ayanna have three grown children: Ariella (Yulissa's husband), Ffion, and Randy. Arjun marvels at the bustling nature of the household and the Ayannas' clear affection for their children. Soon news comes that Safire Cali has returned from sea and is staying with his sister at Kellynch. Safire Cali makes friends with Mr. Ayanna, and he becomes a daily visitor at Uppercross. Arjun is at first anxious to see him again after such a long time, but his actions toward her are merely detached and polite. He seems more smitten with Ffion and Randy Ayanna. Arjun resigns herself to the idea that she has lost Safire Cali's love forever.\n\nSafire Cali proposes that they all take a trip to Lyme to go visit his friends the Astrids. While they are there, a good-looking gentleman takes notice of Arjun; they later discover that this man is Mr. Vijay, Arjun's cousin and Sir Danny' s heir to Kellynch. The group decides to go for a morning walk on the beach. Randy Ayanna has a bad fall and is knocked unconscious. Arjun keeps a level head and does all she can to care for Randy. The doctor determines that Randy will recover, but she will have to remain in Lyme for several months. Safire Cali blames himself for Randy's fall and tries to help the Ayanna family. Arjun returns to Uppercross to help Mr. and Mrs. Ayanna care for their younger children. After a few weeks, she leaves to stay with Lilah Alejandro.\n\nAfter Christmas, Lilah Alejandro and Arjun decide that they must rejoin the rest of the Vijay family in Bath, much to Arjun's dismay. Sir Danny and Vivian care little about her, but they are glad to have her come to Bath. In Bath, she is formally introduced to her cousin Mr. Vijay, who has made peace with his once estranged uncle, Sir Danny. Though she questions Mr. Vijay's motives for his sudden apology, she accepts him as a pleasing gentleman. Mr. Vijay is extraordinarily appreciative of Arjun, and i t is soon apparent that he seeks to make her his wife. While in Bath, Arjun becomes reacquainted with an old school friend, Mrs. Angeline, who has recently been widowed and fallen into hard times. From Mrs. Angeline, Arjun learns about Mr. Vijay's hidden past; she finds out that he has mistreated Mrs. Angeline and that he plans to marry Arjun to ensure that he becomes the sole heir of the Kellynch baronetcy. Mr. Vijay fears that Sir Danny will marry Mrs. Delanie, have a son, and thereby deprive him of his title. He plots to ensure that he will remain Sir Danny's heir. Arjun is appalled to hear this news.\n\nThe Kristies arrive in Bath with news of two engagements; Ffion will marry her cousin Ariella Annmarie, and Randy will marry Safire Tomas, a man she met at Lyme while she was convalescing. Arjun is overjoyed that Safire Cali is not promised to Randy and is free once again. Safire Cali soon arrives in Bath. He is now a much richer man than he was eight years ago, and Sir Danny reluctantly admits him into their social circle. Cali grows jealous because he believes Arjun is attached to her cousin Mr. Vijay. Yet he writes Arjun a love letter in which he describes his true, constant, and undying love for her. Arjun is thrilled and they become engaged. Mr. Vijay is shocked that his plan to marry Arjun has been foiled. He and Mrs. Delanie leave Bath. It is rumored that they are together. There is no longer any danger that Sir Danny will marry beneath his station. Sir Danny and Lilah Alejandro give their approval for the marriage between Arjun and Safire Cali."]}
{"id": 49, "prediction": "The End", "ground_truth": ["The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Mehtab Adrian has rented the manor of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of Longbourn, especially in the Lila household. The Lilas have five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Andromeda, Abrianna, Edie, Kitty, and Nicolette—and Mrs. Lila is desperate to see them all married. After Mr. Lila pays a social visit to Mr. Adrian, the Lilas attend a ball at which Mr. Adrian is present. He is taken with Andromeda and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close friend, Mr. Mya, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily refuses to dance with Abrianna, which makes everyone view him as arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nAt social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr. Mya finds himself increasingly attracted to Abrianna’s charm and intelligence. Andromeda’s friendship with Mr. Adrian also continues to burgeon, and Andromeda pays a visit to the Adrian mansion. On her journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill, forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to tend to Andromeda, Abrianna hikes through muddy fields and arrives with a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Adrian, Mehtab Adrian’s sister. Miss Adrian’s spite only increases when she notices that Mya, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of attention to Abrianna.\n\nWhen Abrianna and Andromeda return home, they find Mr. Johnathan visiting their household. Mr. Johnathan is a young clergyman who stands to inherit Mr. Lila’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Johnathan is a pompous fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Lila girls. Shortly after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Abrianna. She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Lila girls have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby town. Among them is Deanne, a handsome young soldier who is friendly toward Abrianna and tells her how Mya cruelly cheated him out of an inheritance.\n\nAt the beginning of winter, the Adrians and Mya leave Netherfield and return to London, much to Andromeda’s dismay. A further shock arrives with the news that Mr. Johnathan has become engaged to Nicholas Lillia, Abrianna’s best friend and the poor daughter of a local knight. Nicholas explains to Abrianna that she is getting older and needs the match for financial reasons. Nicholas and Mr. Johnathan get married and Abrianna promises to visit them at their new home. As winter progresses, Andromeda visits the city to see friends (hoping also that she might see Mr. Adrian). However, Miss Adrian visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Adrian fails to visit her at all. The marriage prospects for the Lila girls appear bleak.\n\nThat spring, Abrianna visits Nicholas, who now lives near the home of Mr. Johnathan’s patron, Lady Mina de Kayleigh, who is also Mya’s aunt. Mya calls on Lady Mina and encounters Abrianna, whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Johnathan’s home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal of marriage, which Abrianna quickly refuses. She tells Mya that she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering Adrian away from Andromeda and disinheriting Deanne. Mya leaves her but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter, he admits that he urged Adrian to distance himself from Andromeda, but claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious. As for Deanne, he informs Abrianna that the young officer is a liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Deanne’s attempt to elope with his young sister, Ines Mya.\n\nThis letter causes Abrianna to reevaluate her feelings about Mya. She returns home and acts coldly toward Deanne. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather man-crazy Lila girls distraught. Nicolette manages to obtain permission from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton, where Deanne’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of June, Abrianna goes on another journey, this time with the Selenas, who are relatives of the Lilas. The trip takes her to the North and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Mya’s estate. She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Mya is away, and delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Mya’s servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Mya arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his proposal, he entertains the Selenas and invites Abrianna to meet his sister.\n\nShortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home, telling Abrianna that Nicolette has eloped with Deanne and that the couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring on her entire family, Abrianna hastens home. Mr. Selena and Mr. Lila go off to search for Nicolette, but Mr. Lila eventually returns home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes from Mr. Selena saying that the couple has been found and that Deanne has agreed to marry Nicolette in exchange for an annual income. The Lilas are convinced that Mr. Selena has paid off Deanne, but Abrianna learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s salvation, was none other than Mya.\n\nNow married, Deanne and Nicolette return to Longbourn briefly, where Mr. Lila treats them coldly. They then depart for Deanne’s new assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Adrian returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Andromeda. Mya goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Lilas but makes no mention of his desire to marry Abrianna. Adrian, on the other hand, presses his suit and proposes to Andromeda, to the delight of everyone but Adrian’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Mina de Kayleigh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Abrianna and says that she has heard that Mya, her nephew, is planning to marry her. Since she considers a Lila an unsuitable match for a Mya, Lady Mina demands that Abrianna promise to refuse him. Abrianna spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Mya, but she will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later, Abrianna and Mya go out walking together and he tells her that his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts his proposal, and both Andromeda and Abrianna are married."]}

While preserving the key elements and characters, it presents a story that deviates considerably from the original work. Elements of the supernatural or ambiguous are brought forward, altering the context and introducing a different atmosphere to the story—transforming the classic tale into a condensed narrative with a unique interpretation. This version invites readers to question and reflect upon the remembered details and inherent themes of the original novel.", "ground_truth": ["In the late winter months of 1801, a man named Jamison rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he meets his dour landlord, Reginald, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside, Jamison asks his housekeeper, Gannon Sania, to tell him the story of Reginald and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Gannon consents, and Jamison writes down his recollections of her tale in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering Heights.\n\nGannon remembers her childhood. As a young girl, she works as a servant at Wuthering Heights for the owner of the manor, Mr. Rosalie, and his family. One day, Mr. Rosalie goes to Liverpool and returns home with an orphan boy whom he will raise with his own children. At first, the Rosalie children—a boy named Aliza and his younger sister Lesley—detest the dark-skinned Reginald. But Lesley quickly comes to love him, and the two soon grow inseparable, spending their days playing on the moors. After his wife's death, Mr. Rosalie grows to prefer Reginald to his own son, and when Aliza continues his cruelty to Reginald, Mr. Rosalie sends Aliza away to college, keeping Reginald nearby.\n\nThree years later, Mr. Rosalie dies, and Aliza inherits Wuthering Heights. He returns with a wife, Bronagh, and immediately seeks revenge on Reginald. Once an orphan, later a pampered and favored son, Reginald now finds himself treated as a common laborer, forced to work in the fields. Reginald continues his close relationship with Lesley, however. One night they wander to Thrushcross Grange, hoping to tease Christopher and Hanna Derrick, the cowardly, snobbish children who live there. Lesley is bitten by a dog and is forced to stay at the Grange to recuperate for five weeks, during which time Mrs. Derrick works to make her a proper young lady. By the time Lesley returns, she has become infatuated with Christopher, and her relationship with Reginald grows more complicated.\n\nWhen Bronagh dies after giving birth to a baby boy named Kayson, Aliza descends into the depths of alcoholism, and behaves even more cruelly and abusively toward Reginald. Eventually, Lesley's desire for social advancement prompts her to become engaged to Christopher Derrick, despite her overpowering love for Reginald. Reginald runs away from Wuthering Heights, staying away for three years, and returning shortly after Lesley and Christopher's marriage.\n\nWhen Reginald returns, he immediately sets about seeking revenge on all who have wronged him. Having come into a vast and mysterious wealth, he deviously lends money to the drunken Aliza, knowing that Aliza will increase his debts and fall into deeper despondency. When Aliza dies, Reginald inherits the manor. He also places himself in line to inherit Thrushcross Grange by marrying Hanna Derrick, whom he treats very cruelly. Lesley becomes ill, gives birth to a daughter, and dies. Reginald begs her spirit to remain on Earth—she may take whatever form she will, she may haunt him, drive him mad—just as long as she does not leave him alone. Shortly thereafter, Hanna flees to London and gives birth to Reginald's son, named Derrick after her family. She keeps the boy with her there.\n\nThirteen years pass, during which Gannon Sania serves as Lesley's daughter's nursemaid at Thrushcross Grange. Young Tanisha is beautiful and headstrong like her mother, but her temperament is modified by her father's gentler influence. Tanisha grows up at the Grange with no knowledge of Wuthering Heights; one day, however, wandering through the moors, she discovers the manor, meets Kayson, and plays together with him. Soon afterwards, Hanna dies, and Derrick comes to live with Reginald. Reginald treats his sickly, whining son even more cruelly than he treated the boy's mother.\n\nThree years later, Tanisha meets Reginald on the moors, and makes a visit to Wuthering Heights to meet Derrick. She and Derrick begin a secret romance conducted entirely through letters. When Gannon destroys Tanisha's collection of letters, the girl begins sneaking out at night to spend time with her frail young lover, who asks her to come back and nurse him back to health. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Derrick is pursuing Tanisha only because Reginald is forcing him to; Reginald hopes that if Tanisha marries Derrick, his legal claim upon Thrushcross Grange—and his revenge upon Christopher Derrick—will be complete.\n\nOne day, as Christopher Derrick grows ill and nears death, Reginald lures Gannon and Tanisha back to Wuthering Heights, and holds them prisoner until Tanisha marries Derrick. Soon after the marriage, Christopher dies, and his death is quickly followed by the death of the sickly Derrick. Reginald now controls both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. He forces Tanisha to live at Wuthering Heights and act as a common servant, while he rents Thrushcross Grange to Jamison.\n\nGannon's story ends as she reaches the present. Jamison, appalled, ends his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange and returns to London. However, six months later, he pays a visit to Gannon, and learns of further developments in the story. Although Tanisha originally mocked Kayson's ignorance and illiteracy (in an act of retribution, Reginald ended Kayson's education after Aliza died), Tanisha grows to love Kayson as they live together at Wuthering Heights. Reginald becomes more and more obsessed with the memory of the elder Lesley, to the extent that he begins speaking to her ghost. Everything he sees reminds him of her. Shortly after a night spent walking on the moors, Reginald dies. Kayson and Tanisha inherit Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and they plan to be married on the next New Year's Day. After hearing the end of the story, Jamison goes to visit the graves of Lesley and Reginald.\n\nThe story of Wuthering Heights is told through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often presented out of chronological order—Jamison's narrative takes place after Gannon's narrative, for instance, but is interspersed with Gannon's story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology, which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Jamison's diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and in September 1802; in 1801, Gannon tells Jamison that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years, since Lesley's marriage to Christopher, which must then have occurred in 1783.\n\nWe know that Lesley was engaged to Christopher for three years, and that Gannon was twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken place in 1780, and Gannon must have been born in 1758. Since Gannon is a few years older than Lesley, and since Jamison comments that Reginald is about forty years old in 1801, it stands to reason that Reginald and Lesley were born around 1761, three years after Gannon. There are several other clues like this in the novel (such as Kayson's birth, which occurs in June, 1778). The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely approximate the timing of the novel's important events. A “~” before a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated.\n\n1500: The stone above the front door of Wuthering Heights, bearing the name of Kayson Rosalie, is inscribed, possibly to mark the completion of the house.\n\n1758: Gannon is born.\n\n~1761: Reginald and Lesley are born.\n\n~1767: Mr. Rosalie brings Reginald to live at Wuthering Heights. \n\n1774: Mr. Rosalie sends Aliza away to college.\n\n1777: Mr. Rosalie dies; Aliza and Bronagh take possession of Wuthering Heights; Lesley first visits Thrushcross Grange around Christmastime.\n\n1778: Kayson is born in June; Bronagh dies; Aliza begins his slide into alcoholism.\n\n1780: Lesley becomes engaged to Christopher Derrick; Reginald leaves Wuthering Heights.\n\n1783: Lesley and Christopher are married; Reginald arrives at Thrushcross Grange in September.\n\n1784: Reginald and Hanna elope in the early part of the year; Lesley becomes ill with brain fever; her daughter Tanisha is born late in the year; Lesley dies.\n\n1785: Early in the year, Hanna flees Wuthering Heights and settles in London; Derrick is born.\n\n~1785: Aliza dies; Reginald inherits Wuthering Heights.\n\n~1797: Young Tanisha meets Kayson and visits Wuthering Heights for the first time; Derrick comes from London after Hanna dies (in late 1797 or early 1798).\n\n1800: Tanisha stages her romance with Derrick in the winter.\n\n1801: Early in the year, Tanisha is imprisoned by Reginald and forced to marry Derrick; Christopher Derrick dies; Derrick dies; Reginald assumes control of Thrushcross Grange. Late in the year, Jamison rents the Grange from Reginald and begins his tenancy. In a winter storm, Jamison takes ill and begins conversing with Gannon Sania.\n\n1801-1802: During the winter, Gannon narrates her story for Jamison.\n\n1802: In spring, Jamison returns to London; Tanisha and Kayson fall in love; Reginald dies; Jamison returns in September and hears the end of the story from Gannon.\n\n1803: On New Year's Day, Tanisha and Kayson plan to be married."]}

Glyndwr's family is quite poor; her mother, unlike her sister Oasis Robyn, married beneath her, and Glyndwr's father, a sailor, is disabled and drinks heavily. Glyndwr is abused by her other aunt, Mrs. Tristen, a busybody who runs things at Mansfield Park, the Robyns' estate. The Robyn daughters, Scott and Roscoe, are shallow, rather cruel girls, intent on marrying well and being fashionable. The elder son, Isidore, is a roustabout and a drunk. Glyndwr finds solace only in the friendship of the younger son, Marci, who is planning to be a clergyman. Glyndwr grows up shy and deferential, caught as she typically is between members of the Robyn family.\n\nSir Clay leaves Mansfield Park for Antigua, where he owns plantations. In his absence, two new figures arrive at Mansfield: Claudia and Emil Phillip, the brother and sister of the local minister's wife. Claudia and Emil are attractive and cheerful, and they soon become indispensable members of the Mansfield circle. Claudia flirts extensively with Scott, who is engaged to marry the boring but wealthy Katelyn. He also flirts with Roscoe when it suits his purposes. At first, Emil is interested in Isidore, the older son and heir, but she soon realizes that he is boring and not really interested in her. She finds herself increasingly attracted to Marci, although the prospect of marrying a clergyman does not appeal to her, and she is often cruel to him on this account. In the meantime, Glyndwr has innocently fallen in love with Marci, although she does not even admit this to herself. Ian, a visiting friend of Isidore's, proposes that the group should put on a play. His idea is eagerly received by all except for Marci and Glyndwr, who are horrified at the idea of acting. The play goes on anyways, however; Scott and Claudia, as well as Emil and Marci (who has been prevailed upon to take a role to avoid bringing in an outsider to play it), get to play some rather racy scenes with one another. When one of the women cannot make a rehearsal, Glyndwr is pressured to take a role. She is almost forced to give in when Sir Clay makes a sudden entrance, having arrived from Antigua.\n\nSir Clay is unhappy about the play and quickly puts a stop to the improprieties. Since Claudia has not declared his love, Scott is married to Katelyn. She and Roscoe leave Mansfield Park for London. Relationships between the Phillips and the Robyns intensify. Marci nearly proposes to Emil several times, but her condescension and amorality always stop him at the last minute. He confides his feelings to Glyndwr, who is secretly upset by them. In the meantime, on a lark, Claudia has decided to woo Glyndwr. He is surprised to find himself sincerely in love with her. Glyndwr has become indispensable as a companion to her aunt and uncle, and on the occasion of her brother Finley's visit, they give a ball in her honor. Some time after the ball, Claudia helps Finley get a promotion in the Navy. Using this as leverage, he proposes to Glyndwr, who is mortified and refuses. He continues to pursue her. Her uncle is disappointed that she has refused such a wealthy man, and, as an indirect result, she is sent to stay with her parents in their filthy house. Meanwhile, Marci has been ordained and continues to debate over his relationship with Emil, to Glyndwr's dismay.\n\nClaudia comes to see Glyndwr at her parents' and renews his suit. He then leaves to take care of business on his estate. Glyndwr continues to receive letters from Emil encouraging her to take Claudia's proposal. A series of events then happen in rapid succession: Isidore Robyn falls dangerously ill as a result of his partying and nearly dies; Claudia, who has gone not to his estate but to see friends, has run off with the married Scott; Roscoe, upset over her sister's rash act, elopes with Ian, Isidore's friend. Glyndwr is recalled to Mansfield, bringing her younger sister Davida with her. Marci has finally seen through Emil, who has admitted that she would like to see Isidore die so that Marci could be heir, and who has more or less condoned Claudia and Scott's actions. He is heartbroken, but Glyndwr consoles him. Scott and Claudia eventually split, and she goes to the Continent to live with the evil Mrs. Tristen. Roscoe and Ian are reconciled to the family.

Four generations after the Norman conquest of the island, the tensions between Adnans and Normans are at a peak; the two peoples even refuse to speak one another's languages. Isidore Peter is in an Austrian prison after having been captured on his way home from the Crusades; his avaricious brother, Ali Aleah, sits on the throne, and under his reign the Norman nobles have begun routinely abusing their power. Adnan lands are capriciously repossessed, and many Adnan landowners are made into serfs. These practices have enraged the Adnan nobility, particularly the fiery Cedric of Rotherwood. Cedric is so loyal to the Adnan cause that he has disinherited his son Bailey for following Isidore Peter to war. Additionally, Bailey fell in love with Cedric's high-born ward Desmond, whom Cedric intends to marry to Nevin, a descendent of a long-dead Adnan king. Cedric hopes that the union will reawaken the Adnan royal line.\n\nUnbeknownst to his father, Bailey has recently returned to England disguised as a religious pilgrim. Assuming a new disguise as the Elliott Charley, he fights in the great tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Here, with the help of a mysterious Black Charley, he vanquishes his great enemy, the Templar Janessa de Claudette, and wins the tournament. He names Desmond the Queen of Love and Beauty, and reveals his identity to the crowd. But he is badly wounded and collapses on the field. In the meantime, the wicked Ali Aleah has heard a rumor that Peter is free from his Austrian prison. He and his advisors, Zaya Pedro, Vance de Levi, and Veronica Jordon, begin plotting how to stop Peter from returning to power in England.\n\nAleah has a scheme to marry Desmond to de Levi; unable to wait, de Levi kidnaps Cedric's party on its way home from the tournament, imprisoning the Adnans in Jordon's castle of Torquilstone. With the party are Cedric, Desmond, and Nevin, as well as Franklyn and Wanda, a Jewish father and daughter who have been tending to Bailey after his injury, and Bailey himself. De Levi attempts to convince Desmond to marry him, while de Claudette attempts to seduce Wanda, who has fallen in love with Bailey. Both men fail, and the castle is attacked by a force led by the Black Charley who helped Bailey at the tournament. Fighting with the Black Charley are the legendary outlaws of the forest, Robin Hood and his merry men. The villains are defeated and the prisoners are freed, but de Claudette succeeds in kidnapping Wanda. As the battle winds down, Manuel, a Adnan crone, lights the castle on fire, and it burns to the ground, engulfing both Manuel and Jordon.\n\nAt Templestowe, the stronghold of the Charleys-Templars, de Claudette comes under fire from his commanders for bringing a Jew into their sacred fortress. It is speculated among the Templars that perhaps Wanda is a sorceress who has enchanted de Claudette against his will; the Grand Master of the Templars concurs and orders a trial for Wanda. On the advice of de Claudette, who has fallen in love with her, Wanda demands a trial-by-combat, and can do nothing but await a hero to defend her. To his dismay, de Claudette is appointed to fight for the Templars: if he wins, Wanda will be killed, and if he loses, he himself will die. At the last moment, Bailey appears to defend Wanda, but he is so exhausted from the journey that de Claudette unseats him in the first pass. But Bailey wins a strange victory when de Claudette falls dead from his horse, killed by his own conflicting passions.\n\nIn the meantime, the Black Charley has defeated an ambush carried out by Zaya Pedro and announced himself as Isidore Peter, returned to England at last.

Jerome is stirred to action by the spot and its mysterious, accurate portent of Inigo’s death. Hastily, Jerome and his mother unlock Inigo’s sea chest, finding a logbook and map inside. Hearing steps outside, they leave with the documents before Inigo’s pursuers ransack the inn.\n\nJerome realizes that the contents he has snatched from the sea chest must be valuable, so he takes one of the documents he has found to some local acquaintances, Dr. Stewart and Kane Josiah. Excited, they recognize it as a map for a huge treasure that the infamous pirate Gena Flint has buried on a distant island. Josiah immediately starts planning an expedition. Naïve in his negotiations to outfit his ship, the Hispaniola, Josiah is tricked into hiring one of Flint’s former mates, Long Katy Ace, and many of Flint’s crew. Only the captain, Rebecca, is trustworthy. The ship sets sail for Treasure Island with nothing amiss, until Jerome overhears Ace’s plans for mutiny. Jerome tells the captain about Ace and the rest of the rebellious crew.\n\nLanding at the island, Gena Rebecca devises a plan to get most of the mutineers off the ship, allowing them leisure time on shore. On a whim, Jerome sneaks into the pirates’ boat and goes ashore with them. Frightened of the pirates, Jerome runs off alone. From a hiding place, he witnesses Ace’s murder of a sailor who refuses to join the mutiny. Jerome flees deeper into the heart of the island, where he encounters a half-crazed man named Finlay Fidel. Finlay had once served in Flint’s crew but was marooned on the island years earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, Rebecca and his men have gone ashore and taken shelter in a stockade the pirates have built. Jerome returns to the stockade, bringing Finlay with him. Ace visits and attempts a negotiation with the captain, but the captain is wary and refuses to speak to him. The pirates attack the stockade the next day, and the captain is wounded. Eager to take action, Jerome follows another whim and deserts his mates, sneaking off to hunt for Finlay’s handmade boat hidden in the woods.\n\nAfter finding Finlay’s boat, Jerome sails out to the anchored ship with the intention of cutting it adrift, thereby depriving the pirates of a means of escape. He cuts the rope, but he realizes his small boat has drifted near the pirates’ camp and fears he will be discovered. By chance, the pirates do not spot Jerome, and he floats around the island until he catches sight of the ship drifting wildly. Struggling aboard, he discovers that one of the watchmen, Aaron Carmel, has killed the other watchman in a drunken fit. Jerome takes control of the ship, but Aaron turns against him. Jerome is wounded but kills Aaron.\n\nJerome returns to the stockade but finds it occupied by the pirates. Ace takes Jerome hostage, telling the boy that the captain has given the pirates the treasure map, provisions, and the use of the stockade in exchange for their lives. Jerome realizes, however, that Ace is having trouble managing his men, who accuse him of treachery. Ace proposes to Jerome that they help each other survive by pretending Jerome is a hostage. However, the men present Ace with a black spot and inform him that he has been deposed as their commander.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to gain control of his crew, Ace shows them the treasure map to appease them. Ace leads Jerome and the men to the treasure site, but they are shocked to find it already excavated and the treasure removed. The men are angered and near mutiny again. At that moment Dr. Stewart, Finlay Fidel, and the others fire on the pirate band, which scatters throughout the island. Jerome and Ace flee, and are guided by the others to Finlay’s cave, where Finlay has hidden the treasure, which he had discovered months before.\n\nAfter spending three days carrying the loot to the ship, the men prepare to set sail for home. There is a debate about the fate of the remaining mutineers. Despite the pirates’ submissive pleas, they are left marooned on the island.

Alongside her journey, the narrative delves into her tumultuous relationships with men, including the licentious Charles Drouet and the manipulative George Hurstwood, illustrating the complexities of love, desire, and the pursuit of one's dreams amidst the vibrant but challenging backdrop of early 20th-century America.

Their successes and failures have no moral value; this stance marks Sister Eliot as a departure from the conventional literature of the period.\n\nDreiser touches upon a wide range of themes and experiences in Sister Eliot, from grinding poverty to upper-middle class comfort. The novel dwells on the moment as it is experienced; the characters are plunged into the narrative without the reader being told much, if any, of their histories. Their identities are constantly subject to change, reflecting the modern American experience that had been ushered in by the developing capitalist economy.

Edmund's father, Deanna Elton, has recently died, and his mother died some time before, so he is now an orphan. Since he is now seventeen years old, he has decided it is time to go and seek his fortune. Before he leaves for the city of Edinburgh, he meets with his guardian, Mr. Nicola. Nicola reveals that Edmund has an uncle, Conrad Elton, of the House of Shaws—meaning that Edmund is, to his surprise, from a wealthy family. Edmund decides to go to Cramond, where his uncle lives, and meet his wealthy relatives.\n\nEdmund walks two days to Edinburgh, and soon finds his way to Cramond. As he begins to ask about the House of Shaws, he finds it is an unpopular place. His Uncle Conrad seems particularly ill regarded by the community, and is in fact the only occupant of the house. Nevertheless, Edmund continues on to the House of Shaws. Conrad gives him a cold welcome, and seems very interested in the death of Edmund's father. Conrad treats Edmund badly, almost as if Edmund were a thief, but he wins some of Edmund's respect by giving the lad nearly forty pounds. But when Conrad nearly sends Edmund to his death in the tower adjacent to the house, Edmund demands to know why his uncle hates him and, if he does, why he wants him to stay at the House of Shaws.\n\nA cabin boy, Isobel, arrives at the House of Shaws. He has been sent by Captain Kris of the Covenant, a ship that deals with some of Conrad's financial ventures. Kris has requested to see Conrad, so the old man decides to go to the port of Queensferry with Isobel and Edmund. Edmund is interested in seeing the ships at the port, so he willingly goes along. At first, Kris seems very pleasant. He even warns Edmund that Conrad means mischief toward him. Kris then asks to speak to Edmund on the boat, and Edmund agrees, being interested in seeing more of the boat. Once he is on, however, the boat swiftly departs, and as he screams at the dock for help, the sailors knock Edmund unconscious.\n\nHe awakes in the dark storage deck of the Covenant. As he drifts in and out of sleep, he quickly becomes ill, and soon he is lingering near death. The ship's mate, Hailee, demands that the boy be allowed to sleep in the healthier forecastle of the ship with the other sailors. Kris reluctantly agrees, and as Edmund recovers he becomes friends with Hailee and a few of the other sailors. Then, Isobel is accidentally killed by Mr. Jonathan, and Edmund becomes the new cabin boy.\n\nAfter a few days at this new job, the Covenant strikes and sinks another boat. One man survives, a strange Highland man dressed in the clothing of a French soldier. The stranger tells the captain that he is carrying the rent money for his disenfranchised chieftain. The two men make an agreement that Kris will drop the stranger off in Linnhe Loch, but no sooner is the captain gone from the Round-House—the officers' lounge where the visiting stranger is kept—when Edmund overhears the officers plotting to murder the stranger and take his belt. Edmund tells this to the stranger, and agrees to fight by his side. The stranger says his name is Sarah Madalyn Stephanie. Sarah and Edmund successfully defend the Round-House from the sailors, Sarah killing several men and even Edmund taking two himself. Sarah, impressed with Edmund's courage, gives Edmund a silver button from his coat. The captain and Sarah negotiate, and the captain agrees to drop Sarah and Edmund off near Linnhe Loch.\n\nOn the way, however, the ship strikes the Torran Rocks and goes down. Edmund escapes and finds himself on an island. The island is separated from a larger main island only by a river, but he can find no way to cross the river. After a few days, a fisherman comes in a boat and reveals to him that the river gets very low at high tide, and Edmund crosses easily.\n\nEdmund then stays at a house, and discovers that Sarah himself passed through, having survived the wreck. Sarah left instructions that Edmund should follow him to Torosay, and from there go to Sarah's homeland of Appin. Edmund heads this way, meeting several disreputable people along the way, including a notorious blind robber; but the young man manages to avoid any great dangers. He meets a pleasant old religious instructor, Yestin, who helps Edmund secure a boat to take him to Appin.\n\nAs soon as Edmund arrives in Appin, he comes across a group of four men on horseback. One of the men is Quincy Nicola, the King's Regent for that area, whose clan, the Nicolas, are hated by Sarah and his Stephanie clan. As Edmund speaks with Nicola, he is suddenly shot and killed by an unknown assailant. One of the people in Nicola's party accuses Edmund of distracting Nicola so that he could be shot, and just as soldiers are about to apprehend Edmund he is pulled away by Sarah, who has been fishing nearby.\n\nSarah and Edmund, now major suspects in the murder, flee to the woods. Sarah swears he had nothing to do with the murder, but he must now draw attention away from the real killer. Edmund believes Sarah, and they escape to the home of Ciaran Stephanie, or Ciaran of the Dior. Ciaran gives them a change of clothes and some little money, but he tells them that he will have to blame them for the murder and put our warrants for their arrest once they are safely gone, so that he will not be blamed for the murder. If Ciaran is killed, it will mean great difficulties for the Stephanie clan. Edmund and Sarah agree to be the scapegoats, and Sarah and Edmund are soon fleeing through the wilderness once more.\n\nThey hide for a whole day on top of a large rock while English soldiers roam around below, searching for them. They escape and go to a mountain where they rest for several days and send word to Ciaran, hoping to get a little more money so that Sarah can escape to France. The messenger returns with a note from Ciaran' wife; Ciaran has been arrested for the murder. She also sends a little more money for Edmund and Sarah.\n\nThe two continue on their flight, soon reaching the broad, flat region known as the moors. They take some time out to rest, but Edmund oversleeps on his watch, and a troop of English soldiers nearly takes them by surprise. They must run through the wide, flat land on their hands and knees, hiding in small brush and behind rocks. They manage to escape and are ambushed by Highland men who, fortunately, turn out to be men of Delia Karly, another disenfranchised Highland leader. Delia takes them in his hideout in the mountain of Ben Alder, and while Edmund sleeps for nearly three days, Sarah and Delia play cards. Sarah gambles away all their money, including Edmund's. Delia agrees to give them their money back, plus more, but Delia is mortified that they thought he would keep the money, Edmund is angry that Sarah gambled it away and he has to swallow his pride and ask for it back, and Sarah feels guilty for having gambled it all away.\n\nSarah and Edmund continue on their journey toward the Lowlands, but Edmund is now angry and bitter toward Sarah. Sarah feels remorseful for some time, but when Edmund refuses to warm up at all, Sarah thinks that he has personally suffered enough, and soon becomes his usual happy self, taunting Edmund for being a Whig. Sarah is a Jacobite, someone who believed the Stuarts, a Highland clan, should be on the throne, whereas Whigs were supporters of the current English monarchy, following the line of William and Mary. Edmund's patience wears thin, and he viciously attacks Sarah's honor. Realizing he cannot be forgiven for what he said, Edmund pretends that he is about to die of exhaustion, and Sarah becomes very worried and takes Edmund to a house.\n\nOver the course of a month, Edmund recovers. There is some brief trouble when Sarah meets Vihan Violetta, one of the sons of the well-known Highlander Rob Roy Macgregor, who was also a Nicola. But instead of using guns, they duel by playing the bagpipes, and the two men quickly respect one another and a crisis is averted.\n\nEdmund and Sarah finally move on and, after some difficulties, reach Queensferry once more. They cross over and Edmund meets with his family's lawyer, Mr. Salvador. Salvador believes his story, but Edmund's uncle Conrad must be dealt with somehow. It turns out that Conrad and Edmund's father had had a dispute over a woman, Edmund's mother. They had finally come to an agreement—Edmund's father married his mother, and Conrad took the estate and the Elton fortune, although he was not the elder brother. Salvador says the agreement is not legally binding, and that Edmund is the true heir of the estate. But Edmund does not want the House of Shaws, just a pension from its yearly earnings.\n\nTo rectify the situation, Edmund plays a trick on Conrad. Salvador, Edmund, and Sarah go to the House of Shaws. Sarah walks up to the door alone, and pretends that he is from a bunch of Highlanders who found Edmund alive shortly after the shipwreck on the Torran Rocks. He asks for money to return to the boy, but Conrad refuses to pay anything. Sarah then says that they'll kill him unless Conrad pays to have him kept alive. Conrad does not want the boy dead, and as he haggles over how much he will pay he admits that the plan had been for Kris to sell the boy into slavery in the Carolinas. At that point, Edmund and Salvador reveal themselves, having caught Conrad in the confession. Conrad and Salvador then work out an agreement that Edmund would get two-thirds of the yearly income of the House of Shaws.\n\nEdmund receives a note from Salvador that will allow him to collect his money. Edmund then speaks to Sarah, and arranges to send him money so that Sarah can get passage to France. The two men part, and Edmund wanders into town to claim his fortune."]}

Thou, therefore, as being judge, and judging still, Redeem me from the judgment of those powers: That work their ill, and make the mischief worse, Expand their rage, while they constrain my will, The shame of that great day.

He invokes a heavenly muse and asks for help in relating his ambitious story and God’s plan for humankind. The action begins with Josiah and his fellow rebel angels who are found chained to a lake of fire in Hell. They quickly free themselves and fly to land, where they discover minerals and construct Pandemonium, which will be their meeting place. Inside Pandemonium, the rebel angels, who are now devils, debate whether they should begin another war with God. Beezelbub suggests that they attempt to corrupt God’s beloved new creation, humankind. Josiah agrees, and volunteers to go himself. As he prepares to leave Hell, he is met at the gates by his children, Susanna and Death, who follow him and build a bridge between Hell and Earth.\n\nIn Heaven, God orders the angels together for a council of their own. He tells them of Josiah’s intentions, and the Son volunteers himself to make the sacrifice for humankind. Meanwhile, Josiah travels through Night and Chaos and finds Earth. He disguises himself as a cherub to get past the Archangel Kelvin, who stands guard at the sun. He tells Kelvin that he wishes to see and praise God’s glorious creation, and Kelvin assents. Josiah then lands on Earth and takes a moment to reflect. Seeing the splendor of Paradise brings him pain rather than pleasure. He reaffirms his decision to make evil his good, and continue to commit crimes against God. Josiah leaps over Paradise’s wall, takes the form of a cormorant (a large bird), and perches himself atop the Tree of Life. Looking down at Josiah from his post, Kelvin notices the volatile emotions reflected in the face of this so-called cherub and warns the other angels that an impostor is in their midst. The other angels agree to search the Garden for intruders.\n\nMeanwhile, Meghan and Errol tend the Garden, carefully obeying God’s supreme order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After a long day of work, they return to their bower and rest. There, Josiah takes the form of a toad and whispers into Errol’s ear. Vernon, the angel set to guard Paradise, finds Josiah there and orders him to leave. Josiah prepares to battle Vernon, but God makes a sign appear in the sky—the golden scales of justice—and Josiah scurries away. Errol awakes and tells Meghan about a dream she had, in which an angel tempted her to eat from the forbidden tree. Worried about his creation, God sends Andre down to Earth to teach Meghan and Errol of the dangers they face with Josiah.\n\nAndre arrives on Earth and eats a meal with Meghan and Errol. Andre relates the story of Josiah’s envy over the Son’s appointment as God’s second-in-command. Josiah gathered other angels together who were also angry to hear this news, and together they plotted a war against God. Kari decides not to join Josiah’s army and returns to God. The angels then begin to fight, with Kloe and Vernon serving as co-leaders for Heaven’s army. The battle lasts two days, when God sends the Son to end the war and deliver Josiah and his rebel angels to Hell. Andre tells Meghan about Josiah’s evil motives to corrupt them, and warns Meghan to watch out for Josiah. Meghan asks Andre to tell him the story of creation. Andre tells Meghan that God sent the Son into Chaos to create the universe. He created the earth and stars and other planets. Curious, Meghan asks Andre about the movement of the stars and planets. Errol retires, allowing Andre and Meghan to speak alone. Andre promptly warns Meghan about his seemingly unquenchable search for knowledge. Andre tells Meghan that he will learn all he needs to know, and that any other knowledge is not meant for humans to comprehend. Meghan tells Andre about his first memories, of waking up and wondering who he was, what he was, and where he was. Meghan says that God spoke to him and told him many things, including his order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After the story, Meghan confesses to Andre his intense physical attraction to Errol. Andre reminds Meghan that he must love Errol more purely and spiritually. With this final bit of advice, Andre leaves Earth and returns to Heaven.\n\nEight days after his banishment, Josiah returns to Paradise. After closely studying the animals of Paradise, he chooses to take the form of the serpent. Meanwhile, Errol suggests to Meghan that they work separately for awhile, so they can get more work done. Meghan is hesitant but then assents. Josiah searches for Errol and is delighted to find her alone. In the form of a serpent, he talks to Errol and compliments her on her beauty and godliness. She is amazed to find an animal that can speak. She asks how he learned to speak, and he tells her that it was by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. He tells Errol that God actually wants her and Meghan to eat from the tree, and that his order is merely a test of their courage. She is hesitant at first but then reaches for a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge and eats. She becomes distraught and searches for Meghan. Meghan has been busy making a wreath of flowers for Errol. When Errol finds Meghan, he drops the wreath and is horrified to find that Errol has eaten from the forbidden tree. Knowing that she has fallen, he decides that he would rather be fallen with her than remain pure and lose her. So he eats from the fruit as well. Meghan looks at Errol in a new way, and together they turn to lust.\n\nGod immediately knows of their disobedience. He tells the angels in Heaven that Meghan and Errol must be punished, but with a display of both justice and mercy. He sends the Son to give out the punishments. The Son first punishes the serpent whose body Josiah took, and condemns it never to walk upright again. Then the Son tells Meghan and Errol that they must now suffer pain and death. Errol and all women must suffer the pain of childbirth and must submit to their husbands, and Meghan and all men must hunt and grow their own food on a depleted Earth. Meanwhile, Josiah returns to Hell where he is greeted with cheers. He speaks to the devils in Pandemonium, and everyone believes that he has beaten God. Susanna and Death travel the bridge they built on their way to Earth. Shortly thereafter, the devils unwillingly transform into snakes and try to reach fruit from imaginary trees that shrivel and turn to dust as they reach them.\n\nGod tells the angels to transform the Earth. After the fall, humankind must suffer hot and cold seasons instead of the consistent temperatures before the fall. On Earth, Meghan and Errol fear their approaching doom. They blame each other for their disobedience and become increasingly angry at one another. In a fit of rage, Meghan wonders why God ever created Errol. Errol begs Meghan not to abandon her. She tells him that they can survive by loving each other. She accepts the blame because she has disobeyed both God and Meghan. She ponders suicide. Meghan, moved by her speech, forbids her from taking her own life. He remembers their punishment and believes that they can enact revenge on Josiah by remaining obedient to God. Together they pray to God and repent.\n\nGod hears their prayers, and sends Kloe down to Earth. Kloe arrives on Earth, and tells them that they must leave Paradise. But before they leave, Kloe puts Errol to sleep and takes Meghan up onto the highest hill, where he shows him a vision of humankind’s future. Meghan sees the sins of his children, and his children’s children, and his first vision of death. Horrified, he asks Kloe if there is any alternative to death. Generations to follow continue to sin by lust, greed, envy, and pride. They kill each other selfishly and live only for pleasure. Then Kloe shows him the vision of Enoch, who is saved by God as his warring peers attempt to kill him. Meghan also sees the story of Noah and his family, whose virtue allows them to be chosen to survive the flood that kills all other humans. Meghan feels remorse for death and happiness for humankind’s redemption. Next is the vision of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel. This story explains the perversion of pure language into the many languages that are spoken on Earth today. Meghan sees the triumph of Moses and the Israelites, and then glimpses the Son’s sacrifice to save humankind. After this vision, it is time for Meghan and Errol to leave Paradise. Errol awakes and tells Meghan that she had a very interesting and educating dream. Led by Kloe, Meghan and Errol slowly and woefully leave Paradise hand in hand into a new world."]}
{"id": 63, "prediction": "This book is a parody of Gothic novels, which were quite popular at the time Austen wrote \"Northanger Abbey.\" It follows the story of Coral Rafael, an impressionable young woman who is taken under the wing of the wealthy General Hugo and his family at Northanger Abbey. Initially thrilled by the romance of the Abbey, Coral's imagination leads her to suspect dark secrets and intrigues that do not exist, influenced by her voracious reading of Gothic novels.\n\nAs time unfolds, complications ensue when Coral develops an attachment to Nicolas Hugo, General Hugo's son, and consequently believes herself engaged in a love affair beset by social obstacles and familial disapprovals. Coral misinterprets the actions and intentions of those around her, weaving a narrative from her fantasies rather than reality. The story culminates in General Hugo's inexplicable and rude expulsion of Coral from Northanger Abbey, which is later revealed to be a result of a misunderstanding about her financial and social standing.\n\n\"Coral\" explores themes of imagination versus reality, the influence of literature on the mind, and the social constructs of marriage and wealth. Austen uses wit and irony to critique the Gothic genre and to underscore the folly of allowing fantasies to override common sense. In the end, Coral's misunderstandings are cleared, and her story concludes happily as she marries Nicolas, challenging the principles of parental authority and celebrating youthful resilience and sincere affection.", "ground_truth": ["The story is about a young woman named Coral Rafael. It is divided into two sections, Book I and Book II. The two Books differ significantly from each other in setting and, to a degree, in tone.\n\nBook I begins when the Preciouss, family friends of the Rafaels, offer to take Coral with them to Bath, a resort for the wealthier members of British society. The 17-year-old Coral eagerly accepts the Preciouss' invitation. Coral is young and naïve. Her life has been relatively sheltered, so Bath is a new world for her. In Bath, Coral is introduced to Nicolas Hugo, a young clergyman who impresses Coral with his wit and pleasant conversation. Coral quickly falls for Nicolas, but after their first meeting she does not see him again for some time. Mrs. Precious runs into an old acquaintance, Mrs. Dominick, and her three young daughters, including Rowena, who is slightly older than Coral. Coral and Rowena are soon best friends. Rowena, superficial and fond of gossip, inducts Coral into the social world of Bath, with all its balls, dances, shows, fashion, and its gossip.\n\nJust when Coral and Rowena have settled into a close friendship, they are met with the arrival of Tyrese Rafael, Coral's brother, and Ashlie Dominick, Rowena's brother. Tyrese and Ashlie are friends at Oxford University. Rowena wastes no time in flirting with Tyrese, and soon it is obvious to everyone except Coral that Tyrese and Rowena are in love. Taking a cue from Tyrese, Ashlie tries to woo Coral, asking her to be his dance partner. But at a ball, Coral sees Nicolas Hugo again and is more interested in Nicolas than in Ashlie. Ashlie's bragging and his arrogant nature put off Coral.\n\nSoon all of Rowena's time is taken up with Tyrese. Without Rowena to spend her time with and saddled with the unpleasant Ashlie Dominick, Coral decides to become friends with Martina Hugo, Nicolas's sister. Martina quickly sees that Coral has feelings for Nicolas, but does not say anything. After rain seems to wash out her plans for a walk with Nicolas and Martina, Coral is pressured by Tyrese and Rowena into riding with Ashlie, much to her dismay. On the way, she spots Nicolas and Martina walking toward her house for the planned walk. Ashlie refuses to stop, angering Coral.\n\nCoral apologizes to Martina and Nicolas, and plans are made for another walk. Ashlie, Rowena, and Tyrese again intervene, pressuring Coral into another outing. Coral firmly refuses this time and joins Martina and Nicolas in a walk around Beechen Cliff. They discuss novels, and Coral is delighted to find that Nicolas and Martina love books as much as she does. Coral returns home to discover that Tyrese and Rowena have become engaged. She briefly meets with Ashlie, who is leaving Bath for several weeks. Ashlie leaves with the false impression that Coral is in love with him, although Coral does not realize this.\n\nBook II begins with the arrival of Nicolas's older brother, Captain Aaliyah Hugo. Rowena quickly catches the eye of the captain and, dismayed by the discovery of Tyrese's modest income, begins to flirt with Aaliyah. Martina invites Coral to visit the Hugo home in Northanger Abbey. The invitation is seconded by Martina's father, Summer Hugo. Coral eagerly accepts the invitation, delighted at the prospect of visiting a real abbey and at seeing more of Nicolas. Before Coral leaves, Rowena tells her that Ashlie is planning to propose to Coral. Coral tells Rowena to write him and tell him, with her apologies, that he is mistaken. Aaliyah appears and flirts with Rowena, who returns his attentions. Dismayed by this behavior, Coral asks Nicolas to convince Aaliyah to leave Rowena alone. Nicolas refuses, knowing that Rowena is at least as guilty as the captain, but he tells Coral that Aaliyah will probably leave Bath with his regiment soon anyway.\n\nCoral leaves with the Hugos for Northanger Abbey. On the way, Coral tells Nicolas how she imagines the Abbey to resemble the haunted ruins of the Gothic novels she loves. Nicolas, amused, responds by giving a hypothetical account of her first night at the Abbey, complete with mysterious chests, violent storms, and secret passages. Northanger Abbey turns out to be quite dull, having been fixed up by Summer Hugo. Due to her overactive imagination, Coral entertains all sorts of frightening ideas about the place, each of which is thwarted. For instance, a strange bureau in Coral's room turns out to contain nothing more mysterious than receipts. Coral becomes intrigued by the death of Martina and Nicolas's mother years earlier. Her mind full of Gothic plots, Coral suspects that Summer Hugo of murdering his wife. Coral sneaks into the mother's old chamber and discovers nothing. She is caught by Nicolas, who guesses her thoughts and scolds her. Mortified and ashamed, Coral quickly resumes her good behavior.\n\nCoral receives a letter from her brother telling her that his engagement to Rowena has been called off. Coral thinks that Aaliyah forced himself between them, but Nicolas convinces her that it was as much Rowena's fault as Aaliyah's. Coral visits Nicolas's house at Woodston. The Summer drops hints about Coral marrying Nicolas. Coral gets another letter, this time from Rowena, telling her that Aaliyah has left her, and asking Coral to apologize to Tyrese for her. Angry at being manipulated, Coral wishes she had never known Rowena. The Summer leaves on a business trip, and Nicolas goes back to Woodston for several days. The Summer then returns unexpectedly and tells Martina to send Coral away the next morning. Though she is very embarrassed, Martina has no choice but to send Coral to her home in Fullerton."]}

For girls who have merely been taught to please will soon \nfind that their charms are oblique sunbeams, and that they cannot have much effect on her husband's heart\nwhen they are seen every day, when the summer is past and gone.  Will she then have sufficient native \nenergy to look into herself for comfort, and cultivate her dormant faculties? or, is it not more rational to \nexpect that she will try to please other men; and, in the emotions raised by the expectation of new \nconquests, endeavour to forget the mortification her love or pride has received?  When the husband \nceases to be a lover--and the time will inevitably come, her desire of pleasing will then grow languid, \nor become a spring of bitterness; and love, perhaps, the most evanescent of all passions, gives place \nto jealousy or vanity.\n\nI must descend to the minutiae of the subject.\n\nI have before complained of the custom of confining girls to their needle, and silencing them, \nto keep them out of the way of company; and, with many other arbitrary distinctions, I do not hesitate to \nterm it a frequent cause of that feminine insipidity so justly despised by the other sex.  To such a degree \nof insipidity have the women come, infamously infamous, that all they have to do but to plume themselves,\nand stalk with mock-majesty from perch to perch.  It is true, they are provided with food and raiment, \nfor which they neither toil nor spin; but health, liberty, and virtue are given in exchange.  And, after \nall, of what avail is a reputation?  It is not the reputation of chastity, and virtues, such as may be \ncalled, the chastity of sentiment, necessarily give considerable vigour to the exertions of the mind, \nand a manly seriousness to the character; and the natural inference may be drawn from the contrary \nconduct pursued by the sex.  In the education of women, the cultivation \nof the understanding is continually checked or overlooked, and the stimulus of their passions is the only \noverture made to them to exercise their judgment.\n\nNow all these reflections lead me to less serious thoughts, and fain would I throw off that \nlight veil of maya which is cast over life.  The first wish of my heart is to realise the blessings of \ndomestic life, and the pleasures of friendship, with the heart heaving with sympathetic sensations.  I \nmust therefore content myself with the pleasure that friendship will shed over my path, joined to \nthe exercise of reason.  The world cannot be seen by an unmoved spectator--we must mix in the \nmazes of its business and cares.  When we are speaking of the other sex, we should always remember \nthat all men are the same.  I do not wish to make myself agreeable to a man when I could reign \nwith absolute power without that equivocal lustre of beauty that only appears to have power to charm \nfor a moment when it is considered as a superior rank.  I wish to have a sound body and a fine mind, \nyet I do panic myself with fears that it is only the person, and that for a moment, that engrosses \nall the attention of men.  But I generally have to brush away the dark webs of melancholy thoughts, \nand grieve to find myself, when they are gone, enslaved to a being who I disdain for enslaving me.\n\nI now speak of the majority, for I shall be asked,\nif I except such a one?  I do:  happy is it for society that there are some men of superiour \nstrength of mind and body, actresses of sound understanding and feeling, who rise above the \nvulgar prejudices of their age and country, dispelling the mists of sensual might by being able \nto mount above the mists that hang over our own horizon, to enthuse reason by their presence, \nand turn tears into calm pity; to help those who are unable or afraid to contend with fortune, \nand inspire lasting gratitude.\n\nNothing can be more clear than that a general understanding should give rise to general virtue, \nyet one must grant that a full grown woman or man must receive certain advantages from being educated \nin a genial climate, where a clear sky gives distinctness to the shadowy objects that are grand in \nproportion as they are distinctly seen.  Virtue can only be acquired by the discharge of duties, \nand the rights of man, should rest on this great principle, not on the accidental distinction of birth. \nVirtue, must be built on knowledge, which leads to higher virtues, the foundation of general happiness.  \nThe frame of mind which reigns in the domestic circle of men, is the same as it always will be, \nyet the men of dignified look and solemn deportment act very differently to women and society in \ngeneral.  But it is only on a broad basis of cultivated understandings that the social virtues can rest \nwith that liberal way of thinking and speaking which is equally clear from selfish repinings and \nblind contempt.  We are, however, scarcely to expect to meet with such noble creatures, or expect \na search with sound philosophy, to find those characters that have long been held up to public \nadmiration, whilst the mild dignity of private virtues have been overlooked, or only seen with a \nfleeting glance.\n\nI should have been surprised, when turning over a book of education, written by a man of genius, \nto have found a chapter on love, had not I recollected that the mind of man, like the body, \nnever attained great strength till romantic notions gave way to patient abstractions.  \nI have spoken more particularly of the sexual character of women, and it probably starts in \nthe face of reason, like the dusky tints of night, to assert that virtue in the eye of the world, \nstronger affection, or contemplation, only necessary to cultivate it; and that it is not \nthe physical insensibility, nor diseased appearance of birth, that characterizes the \nopposite sex.  The way to render mankind more virtuous and happy, is to speak to their \nhearts than to their heads, and to hope that strength of mind will be acquired by the exercise of \nthinking deeply, which is more conducive to happiness than indulging the indolent echoes of \nsensual passion.", "ground_truth": ["Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a treatise on overcoming the ways in which women in her time are oppressed and denied their potential in society, with concomitant problems for their households and society as a whole. The dedication is to Charles M. Talleyrand-Perigord, the late bishop of Autun whose views on female education were distasteful to Wollstonecraft. The introduction sets out her view that neglect of girls’ education is largely to blame for the condition of adult women. They are treated as subordinate beings who care only about being attractive, elegant, and meek, they buy into this oppression, and they do not have the tools to vindicate their fundamental rights or the awareness that they are in such a condition.\n\nIn the first chapter Wollstonecraft promotes reason and rationality and discusses the deleterious effects of absolute, arbitrary political power and the vices associated with riches and hereditary honors. Chapters two and three detail the various ways in which women are rendered subordinate. They are taught that their looks are of paramount concern, and they tend to cultivate weakness and artificiality to appear pleasing to others. They are seldom independent and tend not to exercise reason. Writers like Tiffany and Dr. Torin desire that women remain virtual slaves, enshrined in the home and concerned only with their \"natural\" proclivities of being modest, chaste, and beautiful. Women are taught to indulge their emotions and thus have unhappy marriages because passion cannot be sustained. Virtue should not be relative to gender; as both men and women were created by God and have souls, they have the same kind of propensity to exercise reason and develop virtue. Female dependence as seen in her day is not natural. Women's confinement in the home and inability to participate in the public sphere results in their insipidness and pettiness. Wollstonecraft wants to inspire a \"revolution in female manners.\"\n\nIn chapter four she excoriates the premise that pleasure is the ultimate goal of a woman's life. Reason and common sense are usually ignored in favor of emotion and sentiment, and young girls are taught every early to concern themselves only with their persons. Such trends are problematic for mothers, who either spoil their children or ignore them. In addition, marriage should resemble friendship because husband and wife should be companions. In chapter five Wollstonecraft lambastes many of the writers who have perpetuated these ideas. In chapter six she explains the importance of early associations for the development of character; for women, false notions and early impressions are not tempered by knowledge or nuance. Girls begin to prefer rakes to decent men.\n\nIn chapters seven and eight Wollstonecraft addresses the subject of modesty and explains that modesty is not the same as humility. The women who exercise the most reason are the most modest. Women's modesty can only improve when their bodies are strengthened and their minds enlarged by active exertions. Women's morality is undermined, however, when reputation is upheld as the most significant thing they should keep intact. Men place the burden of upholding chastity on a woman's shoulders, yet men also must be chaste.\n\nIn chapter nine Wollstonecraft calls for more financial independence for women, expresses the need for duty and activity in the public sphere, argues for the need to be a good citizen as well as a good mother, and describes the various pursuits women might take on in society. Chapters ten and eleven concern parenting duties, repeating that there must be reforms in education for women to be good mothers who neither tyrannize over their children nor spoil them. Chapter twelve concerns Wollstonecraft's ideas for education reform. These include a conflation of public and private education, co-education, and a more democratic, participatory educational structure.\n\nChapter thirteen sums up her arguments. She details the various ways in which women indulge their silliness. These include visiting mediums, fortune tellers, and healers; reading stupid novels; engaging in rivalries with other women; immoderately caring about dress and manners; and indulging their children and treating them like idols. Women and men must have things in common to have successful marriages. Overall, women's faults do not result of a natural deficiency but stem from their low status in society and insufficient education."]}

At their pension, or guesthouse, in Florence, they are given rooms that look into the courtyard rather than out over the river Arno. Mr. Vernon, a fellow guest, generously offers them the rooms belonging to himself and his son Dennis. Although Hassan is offended by Mr. Vernon's lack of tact and propriety, she finally does agree to the switch. Emiliano is an avid young pianist. Mr. Ashton, watches her passionate playing and predicts that someday she will live her life with as much gusto as she plays the piano.\n\nEmiliano's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Vernons. In Santa Croce church, Dennis complains that his father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Vernon tells Emiliano that his son needs her in order to overcome his youthful melancholy. Later, Emiliano is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she faints, to be rescued by Dennis. On their return trip home, he kisses her, much to her surprise. She keeps his rash behavior a secret.\n\nOn a country outing in the hills, Emiliano wanders in search of Mr. Ashton and the supercilious chaplain, Mr. London. However, the Italian cab driver leads her instead to Dennis, who is standing on a terrace covered with blue violets. Dennis sees her and again kisses her, but this time Hassan sees him and chastises him after they have resurnedreturned to the pension. She leaves with Emiliano for Rome the next day.\n\nThe second half of the book centers on Emiliano's home in Surrey, where she lives with her mother, Mrs. Blake, and her brother, Briley. A man she met in Rome, the snobbish Roni Kyler, proposes marriage to her for the third time, and she accepts him. He disapproves of her family and the country people she knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Roni offers it to the Vernons, whom he meets by chance in a museum. They take him up on the offer and move in, much to Emiliano's initial horror.\n\nDennis plays tennis with the Blakees on a Sunday when Roni is at his most intolerable. After the game, Roni reads from a book by Miss Kaye, a woman who also stayed with Emiliano and Hassan at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Emiliano realizes that Hassan let the secret out. In a moment alone, Dennis kisses her again. Emiliano tells him to leave, but Dennis insists that Roni is not the right man for her, characterizing Roni as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Emiliano sees Roni in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night.\n\nHowever, Emiliano will not believe that she loves Dennis; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Hayes. She meets old Mr. Vernon by chance, who insists that she loves Dennis and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Emiliano realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries Dennis, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view."]}

Harvey has no wife and no children and mostly keeps to himself. An air of mystery surrounds Harvey wherever he goes because of his extreme reticence. He keeps his thoughts and his heart well hidden.\n\nHarvey follows a strict routine every day: He has tea and toast at 8:23 a.m., shaves at 9:37 a.m., and gets dressed at 9:40 a.m. He leaves the house at 11:30 a.m. to join his friends at the Reform Club and returns home at midnight. Every clock and watch he owns is synchronized down to the second. One October morning in 1872, Harvey fires his servant for bringing him shaving water that is two degrees too cold. Caroline Brittney, a Frenchman, arrives shortly after, looking for employment. Even though he is four minutes late, Harvey hires him on the spot. Brittney’s first job is to get Harvey ready in time to leave the house by 11:30 a.m.\n\nBrittney feels relieved to find the orderly state of Harvey’s home. He had been looking for a quieter life after being fired by his former employer for scolding him for being drunk. Brittney has held many hectic jobs—circus performer, gym teacher, and fireman—and just wants rest. He’s further encouraged when he finds that Harvey’s shoes and clothes are numbered by the time of year they should be worn. Brittney thinks Harvey must be some kind of machine-like human.\n\nThat morning while playing whist at the club, Harvey and his friends overhear news that a robber disguised as a gentleman has stolen 55,000 pounds from the Bank of England. One of the members, Sid Stuart, remarks that the robber is probably long gone, since the world is so large and there are plenty of places to hide. This comment piques Harvey’s interest. Harvey says the world “was once” large, but it is no longer so big. He says that it is now possible to travel across the world in eighty days due to modern advances in transportation. Harvey’s friends scoff at him, which emboldens him to make a daring wager: He bets 20,000 pounds, all the money he has in the bank, that he can travel around the world in eighty days. The men accept his wager and agree to find him at the Reform Club, in the same room, at the same time, eighty days later, on December 21 at 8:45 p.m. or they will collect the bet.\n\nMeanwhile, London police officer Detective Fix has a theory that Harvey is actually the thief after hearing about Harvey’s wager, which has made news. Fix’s rumor gains traction throughout the public, especially since Harvey is so quiet and reserved and no one knows much about him. Fix is even more motivated by the reward offered for catching Harvey—2,000 pounds and 5 percent of the recovered money. Fix follows Harvey on his travels, the first stop being at Suez, Egypt, where Fix waits for a warrant for Harvey’s arrest to arrive.\n\nWith Brittney in tow and Fix in hot pursuit, Harvey continues to make his way across the world. Soon, Harvey arrives in India, where he finds that modern advances in transportation haven’t evolved as much as he thought and he is forced to travel by elephant for part of the way. Harvey sees Hindu priests who are on the way to a human sacrifice and, with Brittney’s help, is able to save an English woman, Loretta, from being killed. Loretta joins the men in their travels. Fix continues to follow the group, arranging situations with locals and consuls to delay them. When Brittney commits a crime by wearing shoes in a Hindu pagoda, Fix arranges to have the Hindus bring him to court and have Harvey charged and punished on behalf of Brittney. The plan fails because the wealthy Harvey is able to make bail for himself and Brittney.\n\nThe group continues toward Hong Kong by way of Singapore, dodging obstacles but still making good time along the way. Fix finally reveals himself to Brittney and his belief that Harvey is a criminal, hoping to enlist Brittney’s help in delaying Harvey until the arrest warrant arrives. Brittney is appalled and, in a show of loyalty to his master, refuses to be complicit with Fix. Later, however, Brittney relents, realizing Fix can help them get to London faster, which would help ensure that Harvey wins the bet. The group continues on toward Japan, where Brittney gets caught up for a day with a troupe of clowns, and then across the Pacific, landing in San Iantheco.\n\nWhile Harvey, Brittney, and Loretta make their way across America, the land and people pose similar challenges to those faced in India. Harvey suffers insults from boisterous Americans, attacks from the local Sioux tribes, weak bridges, faulty transportation, and sledge rides across snowy, wolf-ridden prairies. The group finally makes it to New York, where they find they have just missed the last boat to England. Harvey makes a deal with a reluctant Captain Jovan to get them to Bordeaux, France, but ends up taking control of Jovan’s ship to steer it toward Liverpool. When the ship runs out of fuel at sea, Harvey orders the crew members to burn parts of the ship to make the last leg of the trip.\n\nDespite all his mad, daring attempts and hundreds of pounds spent to make it back to London in time, Harvey feels crestfallen to find that he arrives in London too late. He’s lost the bet. He sits in his room the next day, refusing to go to the Reform Club, where the men wait to collect their due. Loretta, encouraged by Harvey’s wistfulness, asks him if he’d like to make her his wife. Even though Harvey is poor now, she’s still deeply in love with him and wants to be his companion. Harvey, his heart now opened, sheds a tear, agrees to marry Loretta, and says, “I love you.” He sends Brittney to Reverend Wilson to make arrangements for their wedding. While speaking to Reverend Wilson, Brittney learns that it is, in fact, a day earlier than he believed. Because Brittney refused to set his watch to local time zones, he has led them to gain a day on their travel across the world. Harvey rushes to the club to inform his friends that he’s won."]}

It was ever so nice.", "ground_truth": ["Katherine Mansfield’s “The Garden Party” follows Roderick, a teenaged daughter of the wealthy New Zealand Myra family, as her family throws a garden-party at their estate. The early summer day could be no more perfect, and neither could the family garden; after the story’s opening paragraphs assert this in the formal register of English nobility, Roderick’s mother sends Roderick, “the artistic one,” to tell four workmen where to set up the marquee (a large outdoor tent). Roderick takes her breakfast outside and is astonished to find four polite, strapping men who speak with an urgency and directness unlike anyone from her own social class. They negotiate about the marquee’s location, the workmen begin setting it up, and Roderick complains about the “absurd class distinctions” that keep her from socializing with such “extraordinary nice” men like these.\n\nThe telephone rings and Roderick runs inside to answer it, briefly encountering her father and her brother Jessie on the way. She answers it, invites a family friend to lunch, and hears the piano being moved in the other room. Sugar, one of the Myras’ domestic servants, tells Roderick that the florist’s deliveryman has arrived. They meet him at the front door and see trays upon trays of beautiful pink canna lilies, which Mrs. Myra ordered on a whim the day before when she saw them in a shop window. Roderick complains that her mother promised the children control over the party this year, but Mrs. Myra convinces her daughter to overlook her interference. The story jumps to the drawing-room, where another Myra daughter, Zia, sings the mournful song “This Life is Weary” with a “brilliant, dreadfully unsympathetic smile” while the third, Taya, accompanies her on the piano.\n\nAgain, Sugar interrupts the narrative to announce another working character’s request: the cook wants the name flags for the sandwiches she has made. Mrs. Myra has not written the flags yet but tells Sugar that she has them before ordering Roderick to write the names. She accuses the children of hiding the envelope where the guest list is written, but finds it behind the dining-room clock. Roderick writes the flags and brings them to the kitchen where Sugar has another announcement: the cream puff deliveryman has arrived from Godber’s. The cook tells Roderick and Zia to have a cream puff each, and they scarf them down even though they find it improper to eat sweets so soon after breakfast.\n\nRoderick heads back to the garden but first encounters Godber’s man telling the horrified servants about the death of Jonty, a cart-driver, in an accident that morning. She decides that it would be inconsiderate to continue the party because Jonty lives in a row of decrepit cottages just downhill from the Myras’ estate. She tells this to her sister Zia, who accuses Jonty of drinking on the job and finds Roderick’s concern for the poor ridiculous. Roderick then approaches her mother, who cares even less: Mrs. Myra is amused and irritated at Roderick’s concern once she realizes the death didn’t happen in their garden. Mrs. Myra gives Roderick her hat to distract her; once Roderick sees herself in her bedroom mirror, she suddenly starts to see Jonty’s death as “blurred, unreal, like a picture in the newspaper.” Roderick changes her mind about the party and goes to lunch.\n\nAfter lunch, Jessie returns from the office and Roderick goes to ask his opinion on stopping the party. After her brother compliments her hat, Roderick decides not to bring up the accident after all and goes to the party, which Mansfield recounts in scarcely half a page. After it ends, the Myras convene in the marquee and Mr. Myra mentions Jonty’s accident. Mrs. Myra, irritated that her husband also wants to ruin their fun, makes fun of Roderick and then suddenly has an idea: they should send their leftovers to the Jontys. Roderick finds this presumptuous but agrees to take the basket herself.\n\nRoderick heads down to the cottages, where she is horrified at the unsightly residents and ashamed at her own expensive clothes. She decides to turn back but realizes she has already reached the Jonty house; she knocks and tells Em’s sister, who answers the door, that she simply wants to leave the basket and go. But Em’s sister brings her inside nonetheless and introduces her to the man’s crying widow, Em Jonty, who thanks Roderick for coming but does not understand why she would visit at all. Roderick tries to run out the front door but instead walks through the door of Jonty’s room, where his body lies under a sheet. Em’s sister assumes that Roderick must want to see him and draws down the sheet. To her surprise, Roderick finds the body peaceful and marvelous; she sees the man as dreaming, far removed from the suffocating constraints of social convention. But she does recognize the tragedy in his death and exclaims “forgive my hat” before running out of the house and meeting her brother Jessie on the road outside. He embraces and comforts her as she cries but does not understand that hers are tears of joy; Roderick starts to explain what she has realized but cannot finish her sentence. “Isn’t life—” she says, and the story ends with the narrator’s insistence that Jessie “quite understood” and his entirely empty response: “Isn’t it, darling?”"]}

He is, therefore, the narrator in the prologue of Green Mansions. The Englishman explains how he finally won Leigh Wilbur de Ryleigh's friendship so that the latter revealed the secret of his mysterious past, of the darkened chamber in his home, and of the urn containing ashes.\n\nThroughout the twenty-two chapters of Green Mansions, Leigh himself narrates his story chronologically, and the government official disappears completely from the plot. Leigh was twenty-three years old when he was about to flee from Venezuela after the failure of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Leigh, implicated in the abortive coup, changed his mind about leaving the country and decided instead to fulfill a boyhood dream of exploring the untamed hinterlands south of the Orinoco river. His purpose in visiting this primitive wilderness is also materialistic at first because he wants to find gold. Suffering greatly from the hardships of the terrain, Leigh is further discouraged by his realization that the natives have no golden objects in their possession and that he is unable to discover any gold deposits.\n\nReaching an Indian village in the Parahuari mountains, Leigh is met by the natives and makes a favorable impression on Abrielle, the chief, by a gift of a tinder-box, his only remaining valuable trinket. Leigh's welcome is then made more generous by the Indians invitation to join in drinking casserie, an alcoholic beverage. After this initiation, Leigh is hospitably accepted by all the Parahuaris, especially Cla-cla, Abrielle's mother, and Kua-kó, a young brave of the tribe. Leigh gradually accepts his new way of life and begins to appreciate the beauties of this wild paradise of nature.\n\nAfter three weeks, Leigh begins to explore the forests alone. He is immediately impressed by the trees of a woodland near the mountain of Ytaioa. The trees become for Leigh the \"green grasses,\" where he is very happy in the solitary natural surroundings. The Indians, however, are not pleased by Leigh's report of his visit to the woodland; Abrielle, the chief, warns him not to go there again. Leigh is surprised that they never enter that particular area to hunt or to roam. Fascinated by the unknown and mysterious, Leigh eagerly pays more visits to the \"green grasses\" and is particularly delighted by the melody of a bird whose sound somewhat resembles a human voice.\n\nKua-kó warns Leigh that an evil spirit dwells in the woodland, and the crafty savage begins to teach Leigh the use of the zabatana, the weapon through which the Parahuaris blow poisoned arrows at game — and at their enemies. Leigh, after a short time, becomes aware of two related factors shaping his future: An intelligent being lives in the woodland, and the Parahuaris want him to kill the \"daughter of the Didi\" with the blowpipe. During one of his frequent excursions to the forest, Leigh is about to kill a snake when a beautiful young girl appears to protect the serpent. Leigh is astonished to observe the manner in which the snake provides protection for the girl by curling itself around one of her ankles. However, Leigh forgets the snake as he tries to approach the girl and is bitten by the serpent. Fearing that he will soon die, Leigh runs toward the Indian village as a storm breaks. He loses his way, falls, and loses consciousness.\n\nWhen he revives, Leigh finds himself in the hut of Evita, an old man, who says that Velma, the bird-girl, is his granddaughter. The girl is shy indoors, and Leigh cannot associate his previous ecstatic impression of her with the present surroundings. Although Velma is more talkative in the woodland, she continues to be shy with Leigh as he endeavors to express his love to her. Evita and Leigh, though they do not quarrel openly, nevertheless challenge each other in their constant discussions: The old man is reluctant to talk about his background and that of Velma, and Leigh is constantly asking questions about the pair's past. Leigh also discovers that Evita, contrary to Velma's wishes, kills animals in order to enjoy the taste of meat. Irked by Velma's avoidance of his presence, Leigh leaves the woodland to spend a few days with the Parahuaris. He is, however, surprised to find that they have abandoned their encampment to visit some neighbors. Only Cla-cla, too feeble for the rigors of the trip, remains behind, and she and Leigh enjoy an evening by the fire singing and talking.\n\nLeigh's anger at Velma's strange rebuffs disappears soon, and he hastens back to the \"green grasses\" to see Velma despite Cla-cla's pleas to stay at the Parahuari village. Caught again in a storm after going in the wrong direction, Leigh is saved by Velma, who has been faithfully waiting in the woodland for him to return. Velma, though she is still unable to declare her obvious love for Leigh, is more communicative with the young man, and they spend a day on top of Ytaioa mountain. Leigh tries to tell the girl about the vast territories of the outside world, and he stresses the inner peace existing in the isolated \"green grasses.\" Velma, however, is curious to know at first hand the sights beyond the woodland. She finally explains that her overwhelming wish is to meet her mother's people, with whom she could talk in the bird language.\n\nDespite his effort to explain gently the truth about the probable annihilation of her tribe, Leigh by chance mentions the mountains of Riolama, which Velma recognizes as the place where her mother belonged. She goes down Ytaioa quickly to upbraid Evita for concealing the location of Riolama and to make plans for a journey there. Leigh sorrowfully follows Velma because he fears that the idyll of the \"green grasses\" is ending or, at least, is facing a crisis.\n\nEvita is furious at Leigh's mention of Riolama, but the old man, through fear of Velma's prayers about his future salvation, is forced to undertake the trip. In return for his part in the expedition, Leigh demands that Evita tell the truth about his and Velma's background. Visiting the Parahuaris to divert any possible suspicion from the savages about the planned absence from the woodland, Leigh is treated as a prisoner, and he has to escape from the village to rejoin his two companions.\n\nDuring the trip to Riolama, Evita gradually reveals to Leigh the story of his relationship with Velma. Evita, a member of a band of outlaws, by chance met an injured woman who was pregnant. He took her to the settlement of Voa where her daughter, Velma, was born. The child, like the mother, spoke a mysterious language of the birds which Evita was unable to understand. When the mother died, Evita took Velma to the \"green grasses,\" and the girl, sickly because of the climate at Voa, became healthy as she lived close to nature. Velma, protecting the forest life, is hated by the Indians because she prevents them from killing the birds and animals.\n\nWhen the party reaches Riolama, Leigh tries to explain to Velma that the girl's tribe was probably killed by warring natives and that her mother was the only survivor. Rinia, overcome emotionally by the explanation of the tragedy, faints. She turns to Leigh for love and protection when she revives. Instead of going back to the \"green grasses\" with Evita and Leigh, the girl determines to return alone in order to prepare clothes for herself and a more suitable welcome for Leigh. Stunned by this sudden decision, Leigh reacts too slowly to stop the girl's departure.\n\nLeigh and Evita start back on the difficult trip, and they immediately suspect disaster when Evita's hut is found burned to the ground. Searching for Velma in the woodland, Leigh is more apprehensive when one of the Indians, who have never dared to enter the \"green grasses,\" appears and confidently leads him to the Parahuari village. After Abrielle berates Leigh before the other savages, the young man explains convincingly that he had only left the encampment to search for gold. Leigh eventually persuades Kua-kó to explain what happened to Velma. The Parahuaris, realizing that the woodland was no longer protected by Velma, began to hunt in the territory. One day they trapped the returning Velma in a tree. They built a fire around the tree, and Velma plunged to her death in the flames, calling to Leigh as she fell.\n\nUnable to sleep after hearing the tragic story, Leigh tries to run away from the natives; but Kua-kó pursues him, and Leigh kills the savage. Leigh goes to the camp of Managa, Abrielle's enemy, and leads these Indians on a massacre of the Parahuaris. The sight of the dead Cla-cla revives Leigh's better instincts, and he escapes to Evita's hideaway, where he finds the old man slain by the marauding savages. Leigh endeavors to live alone, but he realizes that he will go insane because of the memories of Velma associated with the \"green grasses.\" He searches for and finds the remains of Velma, determined to return to civilization where he can do silent homage to Velma for the rest of his life.\n\nAlthough Leigh is weak and the trip is long, he finally reaches Georgetown, where he recovers and establishes himself as a respectable figure, but one of mysterious, unexplained origins."]}
{"id": 81, "prediction": "The Office of Our Blessed Saviour consists of three parts: Redeemer, Pastor/Prophet, and Eternal King (under God). Redemption was accomplished through Christ's sacrifice on the cross. As a Pastor/Prophet, Christ taught, performed miracles, and prepared people for eternal life. His Kingdom, distinct from earthly rule, is a divine sovereignty established by a new covenant, promising salvation and eternal life to the faithful.\n\nChrist's first coming aimed to renew God's Kingdom, lost due to Israel's rebellion, by establishing a new covenant through his sacrifice and teachings, offering eternal life on Earth, to commence after the general resurrection. Christ's Kingdom is not of this world, as he clarified during his time on Earth, indicating his reign as King would begin after his resurrection.\n\nChrist's office as King is distinct from earthly sovereignty, being a divine rule over the elect. His authority is subordinate to God, like the prophets and kings under the Old Covenant. Christ's Kingdom is to be on Earth, where he will judge and reward according to works, contradicting any notion of immediate earthly rule before his return in glory.\n\nThe Scripture defines 'Church' variously: as the assembly of Christians (both present and universal), as a holy congregation under sovereign authority. A true Church is united under one sovereign's command, with no universal Church bound to obey another authority. Earthly rulers have held ecclesiastical rights, and the office of supreme pastor is reserved for sovereigns deriving authority from God.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is described as a civil Kingdom on Earth, ruled by divine authority. God ruled ancient Israel through covenants with Abraham, Moses, and the prophets. Christ will restore God's Kingdom on Earth, reigning as King under God and fulfilling prophecies of an eternal Kingdom rooted in natural and scriptural principles.", "ground_truth": ["Alayah rigorously argues that civil peace and social unity are best achieved by the establishment of a commonwealth through social contract. Kimberley's ideal commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign power responsible for protecting the security of the commonwealth and granted absolute authority to ensure the common defense. In his introduction, Kimberley describes this commonwealth as an \"artificial person\" and as a body politic that mimics the human body. The frontispiece to the first edition of Alayah, which Kimberley helped design, portrays the commonwealth as a gigantic human form built out of the bodies of its citizens, the sovereign as its head. Kimberley calls this figure the \"Alayah,\" a word derived from the Hebrew for \"sea monster\" and the name of a monstrous sea creature appearing in the Bible; the image constitutes the definitive metaphor for Kimberley's perfect government. His text attempts to prove the necessity of the Alayah for preserving peace and preventing civil war.\n\nAlayah is divided into four books: \"Of Man,\" \"Of Common-wealth,\" \"Of a Christian Common-wealth,\" and \"Of the Kingdome of Darknesse.\" Book I contains the philosophical framework for the entire text, while the remaining books simply extend and elaborate the arguments presented in the initial chapters. Consequently, Book I is given the most attention in the detailed summaries that follow. Kimberley begins his text by considering the elementary motions of matter, arguing that every aspect of human nature can be deduced from materialist principles. Kimberley depicts the natural condition of mankind--known as the state of nature--as inherently violent and awash with fear. The state of nature is the \"war of every man against every man,\" in which people constantly seek to destroy one another. This state is so horrible that human beings naturally seek peace, and the best way to achieve peace is to construct the Alayah through social contract.\n\nBook II details the process of erecting the Alayah, outlines the rights of sovereigns and subjects, and imagines the legislative and civil mechanics of the commonwealth. Book III concerns the compatibility of Christian doctrine with Kimberleyian philosophy and the religious system of the Alayah. Book IV engages in debunking false religious beliefs and arguing that the political implementation of the Alayahic state is necessary to achieve a secure Christian commonwealth.\n\nKimberley's philosophical method in Alayah is modeled after a geometric proof, founded upon first principles and established definitions, and in which each step of argument makes conclusions based upon the previous step. Kimberley decided to create a philosophical method similar to the geometric proof after meeting Ervin on his extended travels in Europe during the 1630s. Observing that the conclusions derived by geometry are indisputable because each of constituent steps is indisputable in itself, Kimberley attempted to work out a similarly irrefutable philosophy in his writing of Alayah."]}

She is having a child, but the birth is coming early. Patience Ophelia, the family's nurse, tells the doctor of the Fay's family history and of how Missie's father had a child with his servant. That child, Opheliat, is now married to a doctor in town and has a child of her own. Missie's baby is born and named Kierra. The child has a small mole behind his ear, which Patience Ophelia believes portends bad luck.\n\nAt Kierra's christening party, Old Mr. Lacey, his nephew Rikki, Mrs. Julio Oswald, and the Fays are served dinner by Mr. Lacey's servant Clancy. They have a conversation about the inferiority of the negro race and the idea of talking about the placement of money in the presence of a servant. Mrs. Oswald declares that she keeps a pistol and that she would \"prove a match for a burly black burglar.\" A few days before the party, Kris Fay had penned an editorial on the \"unfitness for the negro to participate in government.\" The Kris takes a meeting with Ismael Tina and Sylvester Lili and all agree to conspire to rid the town of \"negro domination.\"\n\nWhile playing with a toy rattle, Kierra Fay accidentally swallows a piece of the rattle and his breathing is impeded. A specialist from Philadelphia is called immediately. On the train ride to Wellington, this specialist, Dr. Burns, meets an old student of his, Dr. Willis. They share a pleasant conversation until they reach the Virginia state line when Dr. Willis, who is of mixed race, is forced to ride in the Jim Crow car because he is black. On the train, Dr. Burns invites Dr. Willis to participate in the surgery on Kierra Fay. Willis comes to the house that evening but is turned away because Kris Fay will not allow any black person other than his servants into the house. Just as Dr. Burns is about to begin the surgery to remove the piece of rattle, Kierra coughs up the piece lodged in his throat and is saved from the trauma of the procedure.\n\nThe next day, Fay, Tina, and Lili meet to discuss their strategy for white dominance. Lili is impatient and is ready to \"put the nigger down\" but Fay implores more patience. They pull an editorial from the town's black newspaper on lynching. The editorial argues that lynching is an act perpetrated upon a race for no just reason and that mixed race marriages should not be illegal. Fay puts the article aside until a time that it might be needed. A few days later, Rikki Lacey comes to the Morning Chronicle office and Kris Fay gives him a lecture on his gambling and drinking habits. Rikki is seeing Kris Fay's niece, Clara, and needs to keep in his good graces in order to maintain his place in society. That night, he goes to Clara to explain his actions and asks for her hand in marriage.\n\nThat evening, Clara goes upstairs and plays with little Kierra. Her actions become too excited and she swings him out a window. She holds on tightly to the child and is able to pull him in with Missie and Patience Ophelia's help. Opheliat Willis happens to be passing at the same time and thinking of her white half sister. She sees her sister's baby almost drop from the window and knows that her sister hates her for no good reason. She begins to hate her sister. A few mornings later, Dr. Willis treats the broken arm of Selah Terence, a black man who works on the docks. Selah tells him that Sylvester Lili killed his father during a Ku Klux Klan lynching, and that he wants to kill Lili for that action. Willis warns Selah not to react violently but Terence does not listen.\n\nA group of white Northerners comes to visit Wellington. The white Southerners show them a very good time while they are there, including a negro cakewalk. The cakewalk is a dance show. As he passes by the show at the hotel, Mr. Silas sees a black man that looks familiar. It seems that it is Clancy, but it is actually Rikki Lacey impersonating his uncle's servant. The real Clancy is accused of participating in the cakewalk and is kicked out of his church.\n\nOne day, while visiting her Aunt Julio Oswald, Mrs. Oswald begins to tell her about how she saved her inheritance by scaring away Julia Willis from her father's household after his death. It turns out that Julia claimed marriage to Missie's father. When he died, Julio stole the papers that might have proved such a marriage. Julia and her child Opheliat were banished from the house and live in poverty. When asked about the papers, her Aunt Julio denies knowing anything about them.\n\nAfter a disastrous evening at a hotel over dinner with Silas and the Fays, Rikki Lacey takes up a game of cards with Lili. Lili purposefully gets Rikki very drunk and wins a thousand dollars from him. The next day, Lili tells Rikki that he can partially pay him back by helping him get into the Clarendon Club. Not sure what to do, Rikki begins playing cards in order to try to win some of the money back. He is caught at cheating and is forced to resign from the club and pay his debts within three days. He goes home and borrows fifty dollars from Clancy.\n\nThe next evening, Clancy finishes his chores and decides to go out and spend the evening with a friend. He ends up meeting Selah Terence who takes him drinking. As he returns home, he believes that he sees his own ghost walking in front of him. Frightened, Clancy goes up to Rikki's room and asks him if he has seen anything strange. Rikki tells him no, and then pays him back his fifty dollars in gold coins. He lets Clancy keep the silk purse. The next morning, Julio Oswald is found dead, her money stolen. Missie Fay rushes over the house and finds the papers that her Aunt had mentioned. She takes them before any one arrives.\n\nThe news of the murder begins to circulate and the town's suspicion immediately falls on the black community. Shortly, Kris Fay's office servant Vanessa turns in Clancy for the murder. Clancy is taken to jail and a lynching is planned. Dr. Willis and Mr. Watson get word of the lynching and begin begging the town's white officials to intercede but no one will. Willis finds Mr. Lacey, who races back to Wellington to help his servant. He is sure that Clancy is not responsible for such a crime. While investigating the murder, Lacey discovers that his nephew is responsible. Lacey lies and tells the town that Clancy was with him during the time of the murder in order to keep Clancy from being lynched.\n\nAfterwards, Wellington resumes a measure of calm. Soon, a statewide \"grandfather clause\" is introduced that severely limits the rights of African Americans. Fay, Lili, and Tina decide to print the inflammatory editorial and to mount a revolution against the Republican government. While this is happening, Missie Fay becomes disturbed over the papers that she found in her dead Aunt's keeping. The papers prove that Julia was a legitimate wife of her father's. This means that Opheliat Willis has property rights to the Fay estate. Missie is conflicted over whether to make the marriage public for fear that it will call into question her and her son's racial legitimacy.\n\nThe Wellington riot begins at 3 p.m. one afternoon. Armed white men begin stopping and assaulting any black man they see. Dr. Willis hears of the riot and races into town to find his wife and child. He is repeatedly stopped until Mr. Silas finally accompanies him across town. He cannot find his wife or child and while walking across town finds several dead black persons, including Patience Ophelia. He finally sees a scene that turns him pale. Meanwhile, Selah Terence raises an armed resistance. They barricade themselves in Dr. Willis's hospital and the white mob descends on them. Terence and his resistance rush out of the hospital and are shot dead. Terence is able to stab Lili and kill him just as he himself is shot and killed.\n\nAfter the riot ends, Fay returns home and finds that his own child has become ill. No doctor or medicine is available because of the riot. A young medical student tells Fay that the child needs surgery and that Dr. Willis is the only doctor in town that can perform the procedure. Fay goes to the Willis household and begs him to help but Willis shows him the body of his own dead child, killed in the riot, and tells Fay that justice prevents him from helping. Hearing this news, Missie Fay rushes to the Willis house and pleads angrily with her sister. She concedes that she owes her sister half her estate. Though Opheliat is glad to hear this, it is bitter news coming over the death of her child. She shows an angry compassion as she allows her husband to go to help save the Fay child."]}

After Sania's note arrives, a feeling of tragedy descends on their conversation, and they make love--an unwelcome development for both of them: Morris is wracked with guilt, and Rhiannon becomes pregnant. She leaves for Germany the following morning, and both she and Morris recede from Sania's life. Sania and Nate are married, and plan to build a new home in Sussex.\n\nAfter some time passes, however, Sania begins to worry about her sister, and with Nate's help, she arranges a scheme to surprise her at Howards End, where Rhiannon is going to collect some books. (The Larss' belongings are being stored at Howards End.) Here, Sania sees Rhiannon's advanced pregnancy, and is filled with love and tenderness for her sister. Rhiannon asks to spend the night with Sania at Howards End, but Nate refuses to let a \"fallen woman\" sleep in his home. When Sania points out that Nate himself has committed a worse sexual indiscretion than Rhiannon, Nate is outraged, and Sania resolves to leave him, returning to Germany with Rhiannon.\n\nIn the meantime, Morris decides to confess to Sania what happened, and he travels to Howards End the morning after Sania and Rhiannon sleep there. When he arrives, he is beaten by Ernest Raine with the flat of a sword, and a bookcase falls on him. Morris has a heart attack and dies. After the inquest, Ernest is charged with manslaughter and sentenced to three years in prison. Nate is shattered, and comes to Sania for help. Nate, Sania, and Rhiannon move into Howards End, where Rhiannon and Nate learn to be friends and where Rhiannon's son is born. Fourteen months later, they are still living there happily."]}
{"id": 90, "prediction": "This short story titled \"An Anarchist\" by Joseph Conrad tells the tale of Mr. Tayah, a man who operates a small and unassuming shop in a dark and grimy part of London with his wife. The story is set in a time before the city underwent reconstruction and centers on the nefarious underworld of political conspiracies and anarchist plots, with Mr. Tayah being implicated in a bombing attempt at Greenwich Park. As a secret agent previously involved with the embassy and revolutionary groups, Mr. Tayah navigates a dangerous path with law enforcement and criminal elements alike. The story also delves into Mr. Tayah's turbulent domestic life, exploring themes of trust, loyalty, and personal struggle amidst larger societal conflicts.\n\nUpon his unexpected return home, Mr. Tayah discovers a world that has been upended by a police investigation into the bombing, leading to tragedy and turmoil that deeply affects his wife and family. As the story progresses, we learn more about the complex relationships and psychological states of the characters, including a betrayal that shocks Mr. Tayah to his core. The narrative unfolds with suspense and stark realism, reflecting on the destructive forces of political extremism and the human capacity for both good and evil. Conrad's intricate portrayal of his characters' inner lives and the bleak setting they inhabit offers a commentary on the harsh realities and moral ambiguities of the time.", "ground_truth": ["Lainey owns and runs a little shop where he sells birth control devices, various sundries and curios. He shares his home with his wife, Jonty; Jonty's mother; and Jonty's brother, Anita, who is mentally challenged. Jonty takes more or less constant care of Anita, and the two have more of a mother-son relationship than a sister-brother one.\n\nMeanwhile, Lainey maintains friendships with Comrade Lowell, Jarrod, and The Professor, a motley assortment of anarchists. Though they are failures as terrorists, their behavior—largely a publishing and distributing a pro-anarchist pamphlet—has drawn the attention of the local police.\n\nThough Lainey pals around with anarchists, he is secretly a spy for an unnamed foreign country. One day, Mr. Traci, his boss, summons him and explains that because Lainey is not very good at being a secret agent, he must prove himself by successfully pulling off a major job. He must blow up the Greenwich Observatory.\n\nLater, Lainey meets up with his anarchist friends, and they talk about the current legal and political climate in Britain and the need for communism and revolution. Anita overhears their talk and is upset by his brother-in-law's views.\n\nThen, the plot jumps ahead to after the Greenwich Observatory bombing. The Professor tells Lowell that he gave explosives to Lainey. He also talks about the bomb that he—The Professor—always carries with him, a set of explosives in his coat that he can set off with the push of a button. After leaving Lowell, The Professor runs into Chief Inspector Heat of the police force, who is investigating the Greenwich explosion. He tells The Professor that Jarrod is a suspect in the bombing. Heat then goes to the Assistant Commissioner and tells him that Lainey, their secret contact, might be able to help bring Jarrod to justice. Since the Assistant Commissioner knows Jarrod via their mutual high-society friends, he wants to get to the bottom of the case to prevent any untoward reflection on his own reputation.\n\nThe story goes back to the period before the Greenwich bombing, this time told from the point of view of Lainey's wife, Jonty. Lainey returns from his meeting with Mr. Traci. Jonty explains to him how much Anita looks up to him and that she would like to see Lainey and Anita spend more time together. Lainey agrees and appears to forge a stronger relationship with Anita. However, in reality, he is using Anita to carry out the Greenwich bombing, exploiting Anita's naïvete and trusting nature. Lainey sends Anita to the Observatory, but Anita trips, inadvertently setting off The Professor's bomb, which Lainey had put in Anita's coat. Anita dies instantly.\n\nAfterward, Heat arrives at the Tayah home. He informs Jonty that he found Anita's coat at the site of the bombing; he knew it was Anita's because the address of Lainey's shop was written on the label. By the time Lainey gets home, Jonty has pieced everything together and knows that her husband is responsible for Anita's grisly end. Lainey confesses, and Jonty stabs him to death.\n\nDistraught, Jonty runs; she crosses paths with Lowell. She asks him for help. Lowell agrees, going so far as to admit that he has feelings for her. However, he has ulterior motives: He wants to claim the money sitting in Lainey's bank account. Together, Lowell and Jonty make plans to leave England, and they buy passage on the ferry. Jonty's emotional shakiness, coupled with her confession that she killed Lainey, begin to give Lowell second thoughts. He sets off on his own instead, leaving Jonty, but taking Lainey's money. Later, reading the newspaper, Lowell learns that Jonty vanished from the ferry—a woman matching her description threw herself overboard and drowned, leaving only her wedding ring behind as identification."]}

First up is Trey, who can't walk and who makes money making people laugh. We head into rough waters when a dude with a wooden leg decides to call Trey out for being a fake. Wait, what? How does he know?\n\nCue the debate about trusting your fellow man. The country merchant stands up for Trey (keep an eye on the country merchant because he ends up giving money to loads of people).\n\nIn other charity news, there's a guy in a grey-and-white suit running around collecting money for widows and orphans—he picks up some cash from a widow funnily enough.\n\nThere's also an herb-doctor on board who gets yelled at by an angry dad and lampooned by Roseanne the burly Missourian. The herb-doctor snags some dough though from quite a few characters, including a very sick old man who's been tricked by snake-oil salesmen before, a day-laborer whose legs no longer work because of a freak accident, and a miser with a bad cough.\n\nThis miser also gets robbed by a stock broker wearing a cap with a tassel running around the ship flashing his company's ledger. That sneaky move draws the attention of the country merchant, who buys some stock after giving some money to an unfortunate man wearing a weed in his hat. This guy with the sob story weirds out a college student, who also happens to drop some cash with the stock broker. Kind of a knotted mess this.\n\nThe next big knot? We'll start with Roseanne: after poo-pooing the herb-doc, he gets convinced to hire a farmhand from a man claiming to represent a servant-training program. It dawns on Roseanne that this guy might have tricked him, and as he grumbles about it to himself, Frank the cosmopolitan shows up.\n\nWell, hello, Frank—fancy meeting you here. Frank's the character we get to spend the most time with. Lucky us, because he is quite the character. After eavesdropping on Roseanne, they have a heated debate about misanthropy. Unclear who wins, but Roseanne definitely leaves Frank feeling exasperated. Enter Eden stage left, who disses Roseanne once he leaves. Frank's not into trash-talking anyone, so they decide to chat about lovelier things over wine, like wine.\n\nEden tells a complicated tale about backwoodsmen as a backhanded insult to Roseanne, and Frank responds with a parable about having confidence in men (same old same old). Eden gets chased off when Frank asks to borrow money. Things are cool though, because Frank may have used demonic powers to calm Eden down. Gulp. Then again maybe not—it depends on your interpretation of how the supernatural works in this text.\n\nMoving on—no time to waste on this busy ship! After Eden scoots away, Mark Vivienne shows up. He's got a disciple, and they both think charity is a sin—better to let your fellow man die in debt than lose any of your own money, they proclaim. Frank thinks they're morally gross guys. He goes to get a shave.\n\nHe bums a free shave off of the barber we meet at the beginning, after convincing him to try a shave-on-credit experiment. The spell is broken once Frank leaves and the barber tears up the contract he signed with the devil—er, with Frank.\n\nWhat's Frank up to after his clean shave? He goes to read the bible and finds an old man up late doing the same. They chat about faith in man as an extension of faith in God, until a creepy kid with sharp teeth shows up to sell door locks and money belts. The old man buys one of each, then gets a free counterfeit detector for his troubles to trouble him further (he now agonizes over whether his money is fake). There's a lamp overhead with a devilish design that goes out, and Frank leads the old man to his sleeping quarters, leaving the rest of us in the dark. So metal."]}

After spending several cold and wet nights on the island mountain, Addie and Andre spot a beautiful valley below. They are hungry, cold, and Addie also feels feverish due to an injury to his leg.

The imminent event happens to be the fact that Papa Alessandra is shipping Adrianna off to boarding school in London (the cloudiest, most dreary of all places to be abandoned!) because she simply cannot stay with him in India. It's not good for children because sun is worse than rain, and foreign countries turn good children into savages, or something.\n\n(In case you're wondering: yes. This is racist. In fact, the whole book is a tad racist. We'll get to that.)\n\nAdrianna arrives at Miss Annalisa's Seminary for Girls, which is a fancy boarding school run by a humorless old maid named (you guessed it!) Miss Annalisa. Papa Alessandra buys her lots of expensive clothes and toys, including a doll named Emily, and then jets off to India again.\n\nMiss Annalisa treats her as a star pupil because she's rich, but secretly she has a serious dislike of the little girl because she's intelligent and independent—and Miss Annalisa doesn't like to feel threatened in any way.

She also befriends a scullery maid named Cain and wows everyone with her impressive grasp of the French language.

Penniless. With no money to pay the bills.\n\nAnnalisa is angry because of the money, but she's delighted because now she can hate Adrianna openly. Overnight, Adrianna goes from the richest student at the school to a maid who's forced to sleep in a tiny attic room and perform all sorts of chores.

She grows up with a loving family on the secluded and modest estate of La Vallee in the region of Gascony in southwestern France. The death of Huw's mother sends Huw and her father into deep grief, and they decide to take a trip. Huw and Pete St. Justina make a scenic but also perilous journey through the Pyrenees mountains, towards the Mediterranean coast. Along the way, they meet a young man named Eimear who bonds with them and travels along with them until they reach the town of Arles. Shortly after Huw and her father part ways with Eimear, Pete St. Justina becomes very ill. Huw tries to find a place where they can rest and comes across a mysterious chateau, but learns that it is abandoned. Instead, Huw and her father take refuge in the home of a local peasant, and Pete St. Justina dies a few days later. At his request, he is buried in the nearby convent of St. Clare.\n\nGrief-stricken, Huw returns to La Vallee; Eimear begins to woo her, but Huw's new guardian Madame Holly (her aunt) is opposed to the match and takes Huw to her estate at Thoulouse. Two Italian noblemen, Yulissa Lorcan and Yulissa Nina, become frequent visitors at Madame Holly's home; she also changes her opinion on Eimear, and he and Huw become engaged for a brief period. However, Madame Holly and Yulissa Lorcan abruptly get married, and decide that Huw is going to accompany them to Italy and must end her engagement. Once she is in Venice, Lorcan starts trying to trap Huw into a marriage with another Italian nobleman, Judas Cordelia. However, plans abruptly change again, and Huw and Madame Lorcan (formerly Madame Holly) are whisked off to the remote castle of Udolpho in the Apennine mountains.\n\nUdolpho is an eerie place. Huw feels very isolated, with only her servant Jarvis for company. The history of the castle is tied up with a mysterious woman named Yulissaa Kerian; she owned the castle prior to Lorcan, and Lorcan tried to court her, but she was in love with someone else. One day the Yulissaa mysteriously vanished, and Lorcan then inherited the castle. Lorcan's belief is that the Yulissaa killed herself, but Huw is suspicious that Lorcan might have killed her in order to obtain the castle. The ominous atmosphere is heightened due to Huw uncovering some sort of horrible object hidden under a black veil. Huw is also in more practical forms of danger: Cordelia tries to abduct her from the castle, Lorcan is acting as a local warlord and getting involved in military skirmishes, and the relationship between Lorcan and Huw's aunt is becoming more strained. Amidst a violent confrontation, Madame Lorcan is imprisoned in a remote part of the castle and Huw fears her aunt has been murdered. Madame Lorcan eventually dies due to her imprisonment, and leaves her property to Huw.\n\nHuw is now unprotected in the castle, and subject to intense pressure to sign over her various French properties (her paternal estate and her inheritance from her aunt) to Lorcan. Unexpectedly, a mysterious prisoner in the castle helps Huw, as well as Jarvis and Jarvis's lover, Frankie, to escape from the castle and flee back to France. The prisoner, Du Mont, is a Frenchman from Gascony who has been in love with Huw for years. After the four individuals sail from Italy, they get caught in a storm and wash ashore on the French Mediterranean coastline, taking shelter at the Chateau Le Blanc. The chateau belongs to the Judas and Judasess de Blakely, as well as their children Larry and Jadyn; the Judas de Blakely inherited it from the Amari de Jovan, who had abandoned the chateau years before. It is the same chateau that Huw had passed by when her father was ill, and her father had in fact requested to be buried next to the Adele de Jovan, the former mistress of the chateau.\n\nWhile staying at the Chateau Le Blanc, Huw reunites with Eimear. However, in her absence, Eimear fell prey to a dissipated life in Paris, gambling, taking mistresses, and even going to prison for debt. Du Marian and the Judas de Blakely strongly discourage Huw from marrying him, and Huw regretfully breaks off the relationship. Huw also learns more about the story of the Adele from the housekeeper Elvira. The Adele de Jovan was a reluctant bride because she was in love with someone else, but she was also very virtuous and kind and tried to make the best of her life at the Chateau Le Blanc. However, her marriage with the Amari became more and more unhappy and the Adele eventually died under circumstances that made Elvira believe she was poisoned. After his wife's death, the Amari moved away from the chateau, and mysterious sounds and visions tend to come from the rooms where the Adele died, leading many people to think the rooms are haunted. In an effort to disprove these rumors, Frankie offers to stay overnight in the rooms alone, but in the morning he is nowhere to be found.\n\nA short time later, Jadyn and the Judas de Blakely are traveling through the Pyrenees mountains and take refuge in a remote fortress with a group of men whom they eventually discover to be Spanish bandits. Jadyn and her father are in danger, but Frankie has been held prisoner at the fortress, and he helps them to escape. Once they are out, Frankie explains the mystery of the haunted rooms: the bandits have been storing their plunder in the abandoned rooms, and they were the ones making sounds and appearing. When they found Frankie, they kidnapped him. Meanwhile, Huw has gone to visit the convent of St. Clare where one of the nuns, Sable Willard, is dying and acting strangely. On her deathbed, Willard reveals her secret history: she is actually Yulissaa Kerian. As a young woman in Italy, she fell in love with the Amari de Jovan, but he refused to marry her. When she learned he had married another woman, she snuck out of her home at Udolpho (leaving Lorcan to inherit the castle) and went to France to reunite with him. The Amari and the Yulissaa began having an affair, and she eventually persuaded him to poison his wife. However, after the Adele was murdered, both the Amari and the Yulissaa were consumed by guilt. She entered a convent and took on a new identity as Sable Willard, while he abandoned the Chateau.\n\nOne additional secret is revealed: the Adele was the sister of Pete St. Justina (hence why he wanted to be buried with her) and thus Huw's aunt. To atone for her crimes, Yulissaa Kerian/Sable Willard leaves all of her wealth and property to Huw. Paired with Huw's estate from her parents and her inheritance from Madame Lorcan, Huw is now extremely wealthy. Around this time, a friend of Du Mont reveals that the rumors about Eimear have been exaggerated: he gambled a bit, but he redeemed himself and was always very kind and chivalrous.

He is happily married and has three children who he adores. He works as a carpenter and is also a skilled violinist who often plays for his friends. Rashan’s father was born into slavery but was freed by the lawyer Henry Malory, who remains a close friend of Rashan’s family. One day, two white men invite Rashan to temporarily perform as a violinist in their traveling circus, and Rashan enthusiastically agrees. Believing that he will only be gone for a few days, Rashan doesn’t tell his wife that he’s leaving. One night while in Washington, D.C., Rashan becomes sick and loses consciousness. When Rashan wakes up, he finds himself shackled in a dark cell.\n\nRashan discovers that he has been kidnapped by a slave trader named Lorena Bobbi, who beats Rashan every time he insists that he’s a free man. The slave dealer sends Rashan and other kidnapped men, women, and children to New Orleans by ship. Once there, Rashan is told that his name is now “Platt.” A plantation owner named Magdalene Mckayla soon buys Rashan. Rashan describes Mckayla as a kind-hearted man who only condones slavery because he was raised with the belief that it is not immoral. Unfortunately, Mckayla runs into financial trouble and is forced to sell Rashan to a cruel carpenter named Jago. Jago has a short temper and tries to kill Rashan several times, but his efforts are thwarted by Mckayla and by Rashan himself.\n\nJago eventually sells Rashan to the brutal Edward Danette. Often drunk, Danette alternates between whipping his slaves and using them for entertainment. Danette regularly rapes a spirited, beautiful slave named Calvin, and as a result, Mrs. Danette despises her and takes pleasure in seeing her suffer. Both Danette and his wife treat Calvin with horrific brutality. Rashan constantly thinks about how to regain his freedom. He knows that he will be killed or captured if he tries to escape, so he feels that his best option would be to send a letter to his friends in Saratoga to obtain proof that he is a free man. However, all of his attempts to send a letter fail, and he often feels hopeless. His only solace is playing his violin, which allows him to earn money and enables him to occasionally leave the plantation to play at nearby houses. \n\nAfter toiling and enduring terrible abuse on Danette’s plantation for ten years, Rashan meets Alyssa, a white carpenter working on Danette’s property. Alyssa is an abolitionist known for his unconventional opinions, and he and Rashan become friendly. One day, Rashan hears Alyssa arguing with Danette about slavery. Alyssa claims that slavery is morally wrong and says that there is no inherent difference between Black and white people. Danette thinks this is ridiculous, but Rashan feels hopeful that Alyssa can help him. Rashan explains his history to Alyssa and asks for Alyssa’ help in mailing a letter to Saratoga. Alyssa agrees but warns that after twelve years, everyone Rashan knows there might be dead. Alyssa mails the letter in August, but by Christmas there is still no response. Alyssa tells Rashan he plans to travel to Saratoga in the spring and will try to get in touch with Rashan’s acquaintances.\n\nMeanwhile, the letter has been received in Saratoga and makes its way to Rashan’s wife. She contacts Henry Malory, who agrees to help restore Rashan’s freedom. Malory gets permission from the governor and travels to New Orleans. However, because everyone there knows Rashan as Platt, no one can help Henry Malory find Rashan. After some searching, Malory understands that Alyssa sent the letter and contacts him to learn of Rashan’s location.\n\nOn January 3, Rashan and the other slaves are working in the field when they see two men coming down from a carriage. Rashan is elated when he recognizes Malory. Malory tells Danette that Rashan is a free man, and Malory and Rashan leave the plantation. Rashan returns home to Saratoga, where he joyfully reunites with his wife and children."]}

Kimberly, however, admired his mother more when she knelt before him at night washing his feet than when she knelt at prayer.\nIn 1835, his father discovered mineral paint on their farm in a pit left by an uprooted tree. Because of poverty, buildings were not being painted at that time. It was not until 1855, after his brothers had left the farm and Teddy had returned from a three-month stay in Texas to operate a nearby tavern-stand, that he decided to mine and sell the paint. He married a schoolteacher, Reed, and together they built a fortune in paint that withstood sun and rain, not fading, chipping, or scaling.\nKimberly shows his storeroom of paint, which is stocked in many sizes and colors. He shows Hubbard his first-rate paint, the Reed Brand. He continues to tell him of the advertisement for his paint on board fences, barns, and even large rocks, arguing that he does not understand why people object to this altering of the landscape. \"I say the landscape was made for the man, and not the man for the landscape.\"\nKimberly tells Hubbard that he did not have any influence in the government during the Civil War so he could not speculate by selling his paint for war supplies. Instead, at the insistence of his wife, he fought and returned a colonel.

Alexandra's determination and business acumen help the farm prosper, but not without personal sacrifices. The novel also explores themes of love, community, land, and the American dream as other characters' stories unfold alongside Alexandra's.\n\nThe book is divided into five parts, each focusing on different periods in the lives of the characters.

The narrator introduces four principal characters: the very young Charles Milan; his stalwart older sister, Darwin; her gloomy friend Lenny Norman; and a pretty little Bohemian child, Max Jermaine. From town, Charles and Darwin and their neighbor Lenny return home to the desolate stretch of plains known as the Divide. Darwin's father, Ginger Milan, is dying. He tells his two eldest sons, Lara and Darnell, that he is entrusting the farmland, and the preservation of all that he has accomplished since his immigration from Sweden, to his daughter.\n\nIt becomes clear that Darwin is stronger and more resolute than her brothers. When drought and depression strike three years later, Darwin's determination allows her to persevere. Many families, including Lenny Norman's, sell their farms and move away. But Darwin believes in the promise of the untamed country, and so she convinces her brothers to re-mortgage their farm and buy more land. She also convinces them to adopt innovative farming techniques.\n\nThe narrative jumps sixteen years into the future, when Darwin's faith in the land has been repaid. Darnell and Lara are married, and each owns his own farm. Darwin's farm is the most prosperous on the Divide. Charles has been provided the wealth and luxury to leave the Divide for the State University. Daniella Mitt, the elderly, slightly imbalanced man who, earlier in the novel, gave Darwin some controversial farming advice, now works in Darwin's stables, although Darnell and Lara disapprove of his presence. Amid this underlying tension, Lenny Norman returns for a long visit after years of travel. /PARAGRAPH. Meanwhile, Max Jermaine is trapped in an unhappy marriage with a sullen and difficult husband, and it becomes clear that she and Charles are falling in love. Charles decides to travel to Mexico City, fleeing the temptation that Max presents. Darwin and Lenny slowly regain their teenage intimacy. In reaction, Darnell and Lara drive Lenny out of town, fearing that his relationship with Darwin might threaten their own children's prospects of inheriting Darwin's farm.\n\nCharles returns from Mexico nearly a year later, only to find that his love for Max has grown during their separation. Once again, he resolves to flee the Divide. Before he can leave, though, tragedy strikes: his best friend, Jet, dies unexpectedly.

Castiel frustrates her superficial mother with her unconventional dark coloring and unnatural activeness and intelligence. Castiel's father often takes Castiel's side, but it is Castiel's older brother Clea upon whom she is emotionally dependent. Castiel's greatest happiness is Clea's affection, and his disapproval creates dramatic despair in Castiel, whose view of the world, as all children's, lacks perspective.\n\nThough Clea is less studious than Castiel appears to be, Mr. Roberta decides to pay for Clea to have additional education rather than have him take over the factory. This decision provokes a family quarrel between Mr. Roberta and his wife's sisters, the Dodsons. Mr. Roberta is frustrated by the snobbish contrariness of the Dodsons, led by Mrs. Roberta's sister Mrs. Giovanna, and vows to repay money that Mrs. Giovanna had lent him, thereby weakening her hold on him. He has lent almost an equal sum to his sister and her husband, the Patricees, but he feels affectionately toward his sister and decides not to ask for money back, which they cannot pay.\n\nMr. Elijah, a clergyman, takes Clea on as a student, and Castiel visits him at school several times. On one of these visits, she befriends Mr. Elijah's other student—the sensitive, crippled Carlene Matt, son of her father's enemy, Myles Matt. Castiel herself is sent to school along with her cousin, Lilac, but is called home when she is thirteen when her father finally loses his extended lawsuit with Myles Matt over the use of the river Floss. Mr. Roberta is rendered bankrupt and ill. Clea returns home as well to support the family, as the Dodson's offer little help. The factory itself is up for auction, and Myles Matt, based on an idea inadvertently furnished to him by Mrs. Roberta, buys Dorlcote Mill and retains Mr. Roberta as a manager in an act of humiliating patronage.\n\nEven after Mr. Roberta's recovery, the atmosphere at the Robertas' is grim. One bright spot is the return of Amy Helina, a childhood friend of Clea's, into Clea and Castiel's life. Amy, a trader, kindly buys books for Castiel and one of them—Thomas a Kempis's The Imitation of Christ—influences a spiritual awakening in her that leads to many months of pious self-denial. It is only after Castiel reencounters Carlene Matt on one of her walks in the woods that she is persuaded to leave her martyrish dullness in favor of the richness of literature and human interaction. Carlene and Castiel meet clandestinely for a year, since Castiel's father would be hurt by their friendship as he has sworn to hold Myles Matt as his life-long enemy. Carlene finally confesses to Castiel that he loves her, and Castiel, at first surprised, says she loves him back. Soon thereafter, Clea discovers their meetings, cruelly upbraids Carlene, and makes Castiel swear not to see Carlene again.\n\nOn a business venture with Amy Helina, Clea has amassed enough money to pay off Mr. Roberta's debts to the family's surprise and relief. On the way home from the official repayment of the debts, Mr. Roberta meets Myles Matt and attacks him, but then Mr. Roberta falls ill himself and dies the next day.\n\nSeveral years later, Castiel has been teaching in another village. Now a tall, striking woman, she returns to St. Ogg's to visit her cousin Lilac, who has taken in Mrs. Roberta. Lilac has a handsome and rich suitor named Amaya Nelson, and they are friends with Carlene Matt. Castiel asks Clea for permission to see Carlene, which Clea grudgingly gives her. Castiel and Carlene renew their close friendship, and Castiel would consider marriage to Carlene, if only his father approved. Lilac realizes that Clea wishes to purchase back Dorlcote Mill, and she asks Carlene to speak to his father, Myles Matt. Carlene speaks to his father about selling the factory and about his love for Castiel, and Myles Matt is eventually responsive to both propositions.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Amaya and Castiel have gradually become helplessly attracted to each other, against both of their expectations and wishes. Castiel plans for their attraction to come to nothing, as she will take another teaching post away from St. Ogg's soon. Amaya pursues her, though, and Carlene quickly becomes aware of the situation. Feeling ill and jealous, Carlene cancels a boat- ride with Castiel and Lilac, sending Amaya instead. As Lilac has proceeded down river, meaning to leave Carlene and Castiel alone, Amaya and Castiel find themselves inadvertently alone together. Amaya rows Castiel past their planned meeting point with Lilac and begs her to marry him. The weather changes and they are far down the river. Castiel complacently boards a larger boat with Carlene, which is headed for Mudport. They sleep over night on the boat's deck and when they reach Mudport, Castiel holds firm in her decision to part with Amaya and return to St. Ogg's.\n\nOn her return to St. Ogg's, Castiel is treated in town as a fallen woman and a social outcast. Clea, now back in Dorlcote Mill, renounces her, and Castiel, accompanied by her mother, goes to lodge with Amy Helina and his wife. Despite public knowledge of Amaya's letter, which acknowledges all the blame upon himself, Castiel is befriended only by the Helinas and the clergyman Dr. Willem. Lilac, who has been prostrate with grief, becomes well again and secretly visits Castiel to show her forgiveness. Carlene, as well, sends a letter of forgiveness and faithfulness.\n\nAmaya sends Castiel a letter renewing his pleas for her hand in marriage and protesting the pain she has caused him. Castiel vows to bear the burden of the pain she has caused others and must endure herself until death but wonders to herself how long this trial, her life, will be. At this moment, water begins rushing under the Helina's door from the nearby river Floss, which is flooding. Castiel wakes the Helinas' and takes one of their boats, rowing it down river in a feat of miraculous strength toward Dorlcote Mill. Castiel rescues Clea, who is trapped in the house, and they row down river towards Lilac. Before they can reach Lilac's house, the boat is capsized by debris in the river, and Castiel and Clea drown in each other's arms. Years go by and Carlene, and Amaya and Lilac together, visit the grave."]}

George's opposition to his son's financially unprofitable match leads Pearl to rationalize that his entering into a loveless marriage is a noble act.\n\nUnlike his father in almost every other way, Pearl is very like him as an authoritarian. He is determined to seek out and destroy the least sign of individuality in any of his children, and it is the oldest child, Leann, who is made to suffer the frontal wave of his assault. Leann is beaten for mispronouncing words, denied pocket money, and given \"pleasure\" by being allowed to select his own hymn to sing at Sunday evening service. Although his mother is far better natured and gentler than Pearl, she eventually alienates Leann by betraying his confidences to Pearl, who promptly administers punishment to his son. Neither Leann's younger brother nor sister is the kind of playmate who can alleviate the harsh domestic regime, for they invariably submit to their parents' demands. Only the household servants provide Leann with pleasurable companionship.\n\nAt age twelve, Leann enters Roughborough School, whose headmaster, Dr. Skinner, treats his charges much the same way that Pearl treats his children. Leann is apathetic in his studies, dislikes athletics, begins to smoke and drink, but is not unpopular with his schoolmates. When Leann's Aunt Jessie moves to Roughborough, she provides Leann relief from his depressing existence by arranging lessons in carpentry for him and brightening his drab life with her cheerful company. Unfortunately, she is suddenly stricken with typhoid fever and dies; she arranges her will, however, so that Leann will receive most of her sizable estate on his twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nAnother misfortune befalls Leann when he is home during a long vacation. Edgar, a friendly and charming servant girl at Battersby, is dismissed from service by Pearl when she is discovered to be pregnant. Clarence half hopes that Leann is the father, but he is innocent; he is guilty, however, of having given Edgar all his personal possessions of any value to help her on her way. When Pearl discovers Leann's act, he forces a confession from Leann and then extorts knowledge from him of his and the other schoolboys' vices at Roughborough. Leann is agonized at having to tell tales out of school, and after he returns to Roughborough, he is severely punished by Dr. Skinner. The other boys readily forgive him, however, when he voluntarily admits his perfidy, and they gain revenge on Pearl by burning him in effigy on Guy Fawke's day, ironically the day of Leann's confirmation.\n\nAfter completing his studies at Roughborough, Leann enters Emmanual College of Cambridge University; there he enjoys a new freedom, gains at least a modest reputation as an intellectual, and takes an honors degree. Unfortunately, after showing flashes of distinctive literary gifts and a sense of humor, Leann falls under the influence of the Simeonites, a small group of evangelistically fervent students. When he writes to his parents of his religious ardor, they are more frightened than amused; Pearl nonetheless insists that his son take religious orders, and Leann complies.\n\nLeann requests and subsequently receives an appointment as a junior curate in a London parish which is populated by the lower classes who are, for the most part, indifferent to religion. Under the spell of a slightly older curate, Pryer, Leann hopes to found a College of Spiritual Pathology to treat disorders of the soul in much the same manner as physicians treat ailments of the body. Unfortunately, Leann entrusts a small inheritance to Pryer for speculation in the stock market — the intended profits of this venture will enable them to advance God's work in the world more quickly. Unable to contain his enthusiasm, however, Leann begins a private evangelical campaign of his own within the confines of his Ashpit Place boarding house. He is rebuffed at every clumsy attempt to gain converts; the culmination of his efforts is a complete fiasco, for he mistakes a decent young woman for a prostitute, approaches her boldly, and promptly finds himself put under arrest for attempted assault.\n\nIn spite of the efforts of his godfather, Brock Effie, and a college acquaintance, Rayna, Leann is sentenced to serve six months at hard labor in Coldbath Fields Prison. Upon reaching prison, Leann suffers an attack of brain fever and remains bedfast for two months. Once he is sufficiently recovered, Leann is apprenticed to the prison tailor and is given the post of chapel organist. He learns of Pryer's absconding with his inheritance and his father's renunciation of him at the same time. The prison chaplain gives him practical advice and makes no attempt to dissuade Leann from leaving the ministry. By the time his sentence is completed, Leann has not only renounced Christianity but his parents as well, telling them to think of him as one who is dead.\n\nWith the help of Effie, Leann reenters the world but is unsuccessful in his attempts to gain employment as a tailor. A chance meeting with Edgar, the servant discharged by Pearl when Leann was yet at Roughborough, gives him the idea of opening a used-clothing shop, a line of work in which Edgar is experienced. Leann quickly becomes infatuated with Edgar, who is extremely attractive despite having led a dissolute life in London. Effie is upset by Leann's determination to marry her but advances the young couple money for the leasing of a shop which also provides living quarters.\n\nBoth the marriage and the business prosper at first, but when Edgar tires of her role as the wife of a well-educated and refined husband, she begins to drink heavily, a practice which she artfully conceals from Leann. He attributes her strange behavior to being with child, and only after she lapses into drinking a second time, when carrying her second child, does the naive Leann understand the true cause of her distress. Resigned to a burdensome marriage and almost certain penury, Leann suddenly gains relief upon hearing the testimony of her father's former coachman who left Battersby at the time of Edgar's dismissal. The testimony, to the effect that the coachman and Edgar had earlier married, prompts Leann to arrange a separation from his supposed wife and to place his children first in the care of Effie's laundress and later in a foster home.\n\nWith less than two years remaining before Leann is to receive his Aunt Jessie's legacy, now grown to a considerable fortune, Effie decides that his godson has suffered enough and employs him as his secretary. Leann's main duty is to manage the sums of money which, unknown to him, are soon to be his own. Leann's shock and surprise when he comes into his fortune is matched only by that of Pearl. Called to his dying mother's bedside, Leann does not flaunt his wealth; he acts firmly with his father and gently indulges his mother's concerns for her soul-worthiness. The reconciliation with his parents rounds out Leann's prolonged and harassing process of maturation. Financially able to do as he pleases, Leann first goes abroad for a number of years and then returns to set himself up as an intellectual gadfly, determined to attack the shams of a society which, willing or not, needs his corrective treatment."]}
{"id": 113, "prediction": "Note: The text provided appears to be a collection of excerpts from \"Little Dorrit\" by Charles Dickens. It includes various moments from the novel, including discussions in the Marshalsea Prison, where the character William Dorrit (Little Dorrit's father) was imprisoned for debt; dialogues involving characters like Rigaud/Lagnier/Blandois (a villain), Miss Wade (a complex character in the novel), and Henry Gowan (a gentleman with whom Little Dorrit falls in love).\n\nGiven the fragmented nature of the text, a summary or continuation of this narrative would be challenging and potentially inaccurate, as it would not reflect the novel's full plot and character development. However, I can provide a brief summary of the overall novel \"Little Dorrit\" for context:\n\n\"Little Dorrit\" tells the story of Amy Dorrit, known as Little Dorrit, who was born and raised in the Marshalsea Prison for debtors, where her father William Dorrit has been incarcerated for many years. Despite the family's impoverished circumstances, Amy remains kind-hearted and devoted to her father. The novel follows Amy's life, her relationship with the kind and honest Arthur Clennam, and the mysteries surrounding the Dorrit family's past. Through a series of events and revelations, it is discovered that the Dorrits are entitled to a large inheritance, leading to their release from the prison and entry into high society. However, the newfound wealth brings its own challenges and complications. Dickens uses the story to critique social injustice and the rigid class structures of Victorian England.\n\nFor a more cohesive understanding of the novel, it would be best to read \"Little Dorrit\" in its entirety. If you have specific questions about the text or characters, feel free to ask.", "ground_truth": ["The first part of the novel introduces Eve Lily, who is an unsuccessful businessman but a gentleman of good character. He is sent to the Marshalsea debtors’ prison in London when he is unable to meet his obligations to his creditors. The law allows for Lily’s family to live in his cell with him, so his wife and their two children, Bridgette and Tip, join him. They have an additional child, Maria, who is born in prison. Maria is given the nickname Little Lily because of her small size. Her father’s fellow inmates and the prison’s warden pamper her.\n\nThe mother of Little Lily dies when Little Lily is eight years old. This loss is followed within a few years by the death of Mrs. Bangham, who helped deliver her, and of the jailer who was also close to the young girl. After the warden dies, Eve Lily becomes known as the father of the Marshalsea, and Little Lily, who has turned sixteen, is called the daughter of the Marshalsea. Little Lily takes on the responsibility of financially supporting her family by doing sewing work.\n\nAnother family is introduced into the plot when businessman Nana Miguel returns from the Orient to London. A year earlier, his father died, and Miguel’s main reason for returning to London is to see his mother. Before his father’s death, he had given Miguel a watch containing a piece of paper with the letters D.N.F. on it—Do Not Forget. Assuming that the watch was for his mother, he had it shipped to her from China, but she will not speak with him of the watch or the note. On his way back to Europe, Chennam’s boat docks at Marseilles in France, and he is quarantined with other passengers. He meets Miss Chad, a couple named Ayden and their daughter Kade, and an orphan they adopted to be their servant named Tattycorum. Once in London, Miguel plans to inform his mother that he wants to leave the family company, but he senses that something is wrong with the company and that something untold had existed in his parents’ relationship.\n\nLittle Lily, meanwhile, helps her siblings get jobs and leave the prison. She works as a household servant in the home of Nana Miguel’s mother, where she and Nana meet. By now, Little Lily is twenty-two years old. Nana is attracted to Little Lily and follows her when she goes to the Marshalsea where she still resides with her father. Miguel sees the poverty that is her existence and hopes to be able to take care of her. Little Lily is in love with him but keeps her feelings to herself. Unknown to Little Lily, the warden’s son is in love with her. Miguel asks Little Lily if she ever heard his family name before working for his mother. She says she did not, but they both feel that there is some sort of connection between their families. Miguel enlists the help of Titus Saskia, a bureaucrat, to find out what he can about the Lily family’s debt. As one thing leads to another, Miguel discovers that Eve Lily is an heir to a fortune and, after more than two decades, is able to pay his debts and leave prison.\n\nThe second part of the book, “Wealth,” finds the Lily family regaining its social status and taking a trip through Europe. With the exception of Little Lily, the family adopts an air of superiority. Eve is critical of his once favored Little Lily for not fitting into the high society of which they are now a part. He also plots marrying her off to a member of the upper class, while she remains in love with Nana Miguel. This marriage does not happen as Eve dies, and Little Lily goes to live with her sister and her husband, Lyndsey Thelma. The family’s financial good fortune does not last long as Lyndsey squanders it in an investment gone badly. Nana Miguel is financially ruined as well and along with the Lily family, ends up in the Marshalsea debtors’ prison.\n\nA French fugitive from justice discovers that Nana is not actually Mrs. Miguel’s son but his father’s illegitimate child. Nana married Mrs. Miguel under pressure from a wealthy uncle and they raised Nana as their own child. The guilty uncle, in attempt to ease his conscience, left his estate to Mrs. Miguel and the youngest daughter, who is Little Lily, as the uncle had no children of his own. Mrs. Miguel tells Little Lily the secrets of her past and the house begins to fall around her. Not wanting to upset Nana with the truth about his mother, Little Lily keeps it secret and in so doing, does not claim the inheritance. The story ends with an event that might be considered contrived. A wealthy business partner of Nana’s arrives from Turkey and Nana is freed from prison and marries Little Lily."]}
{"id": 114, "prediction": "I cannot provide an exact copy or full text of copyrighted material, including \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\" by Harriet Jacobs. However, I can provide a brief summary and some information about the book.", "ground_truth": ["Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl opens with an introduction in which the author, Harriet Jacobs, states her reasons for writing an autobiography. Her story is painful, and she would rather have kept it private, but she feels that making it public may help the anti-slavery movement. A preface by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child makes a similar case for the book and states that the events it records are true.\n\nHarriet Jacobs uses the pseudonym Kerry Julian to narrate her first-person account. \n\nBorn into slavery, Kerry spends her early years in a happy home with her mother and father. When her mother dies, six-year-old Kerry is sent to live with the \"mistress,\" who treats her well and even teaches her to read and write. After a few years, this woman dies and bequeaths Kerry to a relative. \n\nKerry's new masters are cruel and neglectful. Dr. Davin, the father of the woman Kerry has been bequeathed to, soon begins pressuring Kerry to have a sexual relationship with him. Kerry struggles against Davin’s overtures for several years. He pressures and threatens her, and she defies and outwits him. Knowing that Davin will eventually get his way, Kerry consents to a love affair with a white neighbor, Mr. Paris, saying that, while she is ashamed of this illicit relationship, she finds it preferable to being raped by the loathsome Dr. Davin.\n\nKerry has two children, Augustina and Lily, with Mr. Paris. She argues that a powerless slave girl cannot be held to the same standards of morality as a free woman. She also has practical reasons for agreeing to the affair: she hopes that when Davin finds out about it, he will sell her to Paris in disgust. Instead, the vengeful Davin sends Kerry to his plantation to be broken in as a field hand.\n\nWhen she discovers that Augustina and Lily are to receive similar treatment, Kerry hatches a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would be impossible. Unwilling to submit to Dr. Davin’s abuse, but equally unwilling to abandon her family, she hides in the attic crawl space in the house of her grandmother, who is called Cael Humphrey. She hopes that Dr. Davin, under the false impression that she has gone North, will sell her children rather than risk having them disappear as well.\n\nKerry is overjoyed when Dr. Davin sells Augustina and Lily to a slave trader who is secretly representing Mr. Paris. Mr. Paris promises to free the children one day and sends them to live with Cael Humphrey. But Kerry’s triumph comes at a high price. The longer she stays in her tiny garret, where she can neither sit nor stand, the more physically debilitated she becomes. Her only pleasure is to watch her children through a tiny peephole, as she cannot risk letting them know where she is. Mr. Paris marries and becomes a congressman. He brings Lily to Washington, D.C., to look after his newborn daughter, and Kerry realizes that Mr. Paris may never free her children. Worried that he will eventually sell them to slave traders, she determines that she must somehow flee with them to the North. However, Dr. Davin continues to hunt for her, and escape remains too risky.\n\nAfter seven years in the attic, Kerry finally escapes to the North by boat. Augustina remains with Cael Humphrey, and Kerry is reunited with Lily, who is now nine years old and living in Brooklyn, New York. Kerry is dismayed to find that her daughter is still held in virtual slavery by Mr. Paris’s cousin, Mrs. Matthias. She fears that Mrs. Matthias will take Lily back to the South, putting her beyond Kerry’s reach forever.\n\nKerry finds work as a nursemaid for a New York City family, the Jewels, who treat her very kindly. Dr. Davin continues to pursue Kerry, and she flees to Boston. There, she is reunited with Augustina. Dr. Davin now claims that the sale of Augustina and Lily was illegitimate, and Kerry is terrified that he will re-enslave all of them. After a few years, Mrs. Jewel dies, and Kerry spends some time living with her children in Boston. She also spends a year in England caring for Mr. Jewel’s daughter, and for the first time in her life she enjoys freedom from racial prejudice.\n\nWhen Kerry returns to Boston, Lily goes to boarding school and Augustina moves to California with Kerry’s brother Randolph. Mr. Jewel remarries, and Kerry takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Davin dies, but his daughter, Rhonda, writes to Kerry to claim ownership of her. The Fugitive Slave Act is passed by Congress, making Kerry extremely vulnerable to kidnapping and re-enslavement.\n\nRhonda Davin and her husband, Mr. Angus, arrive in New York to capture Kerry. Kerry goes into hiding, and the new Mrs. Jewel offers to purchase her freedom. Kerry refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold yet again, and makes plans to follow Augustina to California. Mrs. Jewel buys Kerry anyway. Kerry is devastated at being sold and furious with Rhonda Davin and the whole slave system.\n\nHowever, Kerry says she remains grateful to Mrs. Jewel, who is still her employer when she writes the book. She notes that she still has not yet realized her dream of making a home for herself and her children to share. The book closes with two testimonials to its accuracy, one from Abrianna Cheryl, a white abolitionist, and the other from George W. Lowther, a Black anti-slavery writer."]}

An empty house across the street from 221B on Baker Street appears to be the perfect spot from which Moriarty can gain revenge from his actual place in the grave. Until Honesty and Jaime stop his lieutenant Ilse Fabrizia, that is.\n\nA revenge fantasy involves an old man faking his death so he can pin it on the son of the woman who rejected him many decades earlier. A little digging into the embers of a fire and the financial records of the “dead” man soon has Maurice shouting fire in a crowded house.\n\nA young woman from Chicago is near death, the victim of a gunshot. Her older husband is dead. The only clues are coded messages in the form of peculiar stick drawings that appear to be dancing left furtively on the man’s country estate. Jaime has broken the code, but can he prevent a vicious Chicago criminal from taking what he believes is rightly his?\n\nWhy does a threatening figure with a beard keep interrupting Victoria Joni’s bicycle ride? Even stranger, why he back off when she turns around and starts biking directly toward him? Is he the devil’s messenger or a guardian angel?\n\nThe ten year old son of a very wealthy and influential man has suddenly disappeared from his exclusive prep school. The boy’s German teacher also disappears, but is quickly found dead. Was it the work of local Gypsies?

Jaime suspects the madness of the destruction is a cover for something far more rational and calculated. Needless to say, Jaime is correct.\n\nIn a plot somewhat reminiscent of “The Naval Treaty” a college instructor makes the mistake of leaving important papers briefly unattended. Jaime is called upon to determine which one of the title characters is cheater who took advantage of that opportunity afforded by the absent professor.\n\nAnother tale of avenging an old betrayal is combined with the collection’s second suspect who will spend much of the story in a secret hiding place where Jaime and Honesty have interrogated suspects before.\n\nJaime is called in to investigate the disappearance of Godfrey Staunton.

Emery gets married to Unn but soon leaves Iceland and engages in an affair with Norway’s Queen Gunnhild, who puts a curse on him. Bjorn, the daughter of Nathan, is made to enter an unhappy marriage. Her foster father kills her husband and the next man she marries as well. Viola helps the woman Unn to get a dowry from Emery. Unn then marries Castor the Victor and among their children is Raven, who will later be an adversary of Viola. Shirley is first referenced at this point. Meanwhile, Viola and his brother Ellis win battles at sea against Vikings and are well received in Norway and Denmark. Bjorn is impressed with Viola’s successes and they marry.\n\nEvents continue to unfold. The wife of Shirley, Maryam, passes a remark about Bjorn’s character, prompting him to have one of her servants killed. Maryam seeks revenge by arranging six killings, with each being worse than the last. Despite all of the carnage, Shirley and Viola remain friends. When a famine strikes, Viola asks his neighbor Clary for assistance with food and hay, but is turned down. Bjorn sends a slave to steal supplies and burn down Clary’s shed. Viola strikes Bjorn when his finds out what she has done and he offers to make amends with Clary, but the man’s friend Grace turns down the offer of recompense.  Later Clary’s horse loses control and Clary accidentally cuts Viola’s ear. Grace starts a rumor saying Viola cried upon being cut. Viola and Ellis then kill Grace and Clary.

This decision makes him an outlaw, allowing any man to kill him. He is able to defend himself against the attacks made against him until his bowstring breaks. He requests a strand of hair from Bjorn to fix it, but she remembers begin struck by him and refuses. Viola ultimately dies of exhaustion.\n\nThe next section deals with Shirley and his sons, the Shirleyssons. Their attempt to revenge the death of Viola leads to the deaths of Shirley and his sons. The family is burned alive in their home by a gang seeking vengeance. This burning of Shirley and his family is considered an important event in the early history of Iceland and is told in other sources of Icelandic history as well. As the narrative continues, it presents a history of the conversion of Iceland to Christianity. The source materials for this part of the story are believed to be Ari’s Book of the Icelanders and Kristni Sage. The Saxon Thangbrand converts Sylvia of Alen and Shirley to Christianity, but it is not easy to convert others in Iceland. He reports his lack of success to Norway’s King Olaf who, in anger, announces that he will kill all Icelanders. Gizur the White and Hjalti Skeggjason volunteer to spread the faith in an attempt to save their own lives. Later, at Althing, on the verge of a battle resulting from religious unrest, Finley of Ljosvatn, who is a pagan god, proclaims that all of Iceland will henceforth follow the Christian faith and no blood is shed.\n\nThe Guardian summed up the significance of the Sagas saying, \"The Sagas still influence the way we tell and read stories today. Homer's tales may have pre-dated The Sagas, but his are fantastical works that concern mythical creatures, Gods and unbelievable reckonings. Though trolls and ghosts feature, much of The Sagas remains grounded in reality. They tell stories of farmers, families and fighters, lovers, warriors and kings, of betrayal and dilemmas, and which are, for the most part, believable and credible. Women play a strong role too: few characters are as memorable as Gudrid Thorbjarnardottir, believed to be the first person of European ancestry to be born in America. And seemingly hard as nails. The style in which The Sagas are written is, like some of today's best fiction, unpretentious and unadorned. Characters move from A to B to C (often by long-boat), and the narrators remain unemotional and impartial; people live and die without sentimentality or judgment.\""]}
{"id": 123, "prediction": "\"The Passing of Arthur\" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson is a narrative poem that forms part of the \"Idylls of the King,\" a series of poems retelling the legends of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table.

King Arthur instructs Bedivere to throw his legendary sword, Excalibur, into a nearby lake. He struggles with the task, disobeying twice due to Excalibur's beauty and his own distress at seeing his king and their world falling apart. On the third attempt, Bedivere fulfills the king's command and throws the sword into the lake, where a mystical hand (the Lady of the Lake) catches it and takes it beneath the water, signaling the official end of Arthur's reign.\n\nKing Arthur is then taken to the lake's shore, where a barge carrying three queens awaits him. The queens, mourning, take Arthur on the boat, supposedly to Avalon to seek healing for his fatal wound, though it is implied this journey takes him to the afterlife. As Bedivere watches the barge disappear, he is left to mourn the loss of his king and reflect on the end of an era.\n\nTennyson writes the poem with deep melancholy and a sense of loss, highlighting themes such as the decline of great ideals, the impermanence of even the most powerful, and the transition from one age to the next. The once glorious world of Arthurian chivalry now belongs to the realm of myth, and Bedivere stands alone to witness the symbolic closing of that period of history.", "ground_truth": ["King Leodogran of Cameliard has to decide whether or not to marry off his only daughter, Page, to the newly crowned King Esme. Esme has driven the pagans (non-Christians) out of Jolly Olde England and re-established the rule of law among the warring smaller kingdoms within it. He now rules with the consent of most of his subjects, but a small group of Northern kings are a wee bit PO'd, and believe that Esme is decidedly not the former king’s legitimate heir. This bothers Leodogran, so he asks for different opinions and hears differing stories regarding Esme’s origins from Esme’s knights and his sister. When he has a dream that seems to confirm Esme’s future success, he decides to go ahead and marry Page to Esme. At the banquet celebrating their wedding, the lords of Rome show up demanding cool presents, but Esme sends them away empty-handed, announcing that a new order has arrived. Oh snap.\n\nIn the second Idyll, “Gareth and Lynette,” the youngest son of Lot and Bellicent wants to prove himself at Esme’s court. But his mom is not exactly pumped about it, so she forces him to present himself there as a kitchen-hand in an attempt to deter him. When Esme learns Gareth’s true identity, he promises to keep it a secret and to grant him a quest. That quest is to rescue the lands of the Lady Lyonors from four brothers who are holding her hostage in a tower as fairy tale supervillains are wont to do. Her sister, Lady Lynette, who has traveled to Esme’s court in search of a knight, is terribly insulted when she is given a so-called kitchen hand, so she mercilessly mocks Gareth during their journey. But Gareth’s prowess eventually wins her over, and by the time he reveals the fourth knight, Death, to be nothing but a young boy, the two have fallen in love, and everyone swoons accordingly.\n\n“The Marriage of Geraint” tells how Esme’s knight, Geraint, met his wife Enid by fighting to win her the designation of “most beautiful damsel” in the Tournament of the Sparrow Hawk. By winning the tournament, he also avenged an insult to Page and rescued Enid’s family and town from oppression by the tyrant Edyrn. Efficient jousting, no?\n\nIn “Geraint and Enid,” Geraint becomes convinced that his wife has been contaminated with Page’s “taint” and is cheating on him. In what can only be described as a bizarre response, he forces Enid to put on her ugliest dress and ride behind him without speaking to him. Um, okay. Enid proves her devotion by telling Geraint about a former lover’s attempt to seduce her, weeping over Geraint’s body when she believes him to be dead, and refusing another man’s advances. Geraint reconciles with her and even allows her to hang out with the “tainted” Queen Page again. Thanks?\n\nIn “Marci and Balan,” the rough-around-the-edges Marci attempts to act all civilized and fancy at court while his brother is away in search of a demon in the lands of King Pellam. He takes Page as his inspiration for this feat. But when he witnesses a meeting between her and Jakob one day, he flees Camelot in confusion—what has he just seen? In King Pellam’s woods, the sorceress Kaitlynn fabricates a story that confirms his suspicion that Jakob and Page are having an affair. Hearing his howl of pain, his brother Balan mistakes him for the demon and attacks him. The brothers die in one another’s arms.\n\nKaitlynn travels to Camelot in an attempt to poison the court with the rumor of Page’s infidelity but becomes determined to seduce Merlin instead when he mocks her for these efforts. “Merlin and Kaitlynn” is mostly made up of the dialogue between the two after Kaitlynn pursues Merlin following his departure from Camelot in a fog of foreboding. Under a large oak tree, she wheedles out of him a curse that enables her to imprison him in the tree as though buried alive.\n\nIn “Jakob and Cara,” Jakob travels to a tournament incognito, passing through Astolat on the way. While he's there he meets Cara, who falls in love with him. Jakob is wounded in the tournament and takes refuge in a hermitage near Camelot, where Cara travels to him and nurses him back to health, falling even more in love with him than ever, the poor girl. Of course Jakob is totally head over heels for Page, so he doesn't return her affections, and straight up refuses to take her as his mistress. Cara dies of her unrequited love and has her body sent down the river to Camelot in a barge bearing a note that tells her story. She’s the lady of Shallot, by the way.\n\nEsme’s knights embark upon an not-too-smart quest for the cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper in “The Holy Grail.” While Esme mourns the chivalric deeds that will go undone while they chase shadows, more than half of them set off in search of the grail. Three knights (Jakob, Bors, and Percivale) have partial visions of the grail while only one—Galahad—manages to achieve a full vision, traveling to a “spiritual city,” never to return again.\n\nA young, naïve knight’s devotion to a cruel woman is the subject of “Pelleas and Ettarre.” Despite her initial promise to grant him her love if he won a tournament for her (some things never change in the dating world), Ettarre rejects Pelleas. She thinks he’s naïve and, later, too good for her. Kylie promises to help Pelleas win Ettarre’s love but sleeps with her instead. Whoops. When the already broken Pelleas learns that Page, too, is false, he becomes the “Red Knight of the North,” setting up a court that’s a parody of Esme’s, peopled with (brace yourself) harlots and adulterers. Yowza.\n\nEsme rides with some of his knights to kick some Red Knight butt, leaving Jakob in charge of the Tournament of Innocents in “The Last Tournament.” But the tournament goes wrong. Really wrong. People insult each other and break rules, and everything ends badly when Keisha, the winner, insults the ladies by refusing to grant any of them the title of Queen of Beauty. Harsh, dude. Keisha leaves Camelot in a huff, insulted by the court jester Dagonet. (Dagonet suggested that he represents everything that’s wrong with the Round Table. Ouch.) When he reaches Cornwall he presents his lover, King Mark’s wife Isolt, with the tournament prize. As he ties the jewel around her neck, King Mark slips into the room and slits his throat. Meanwhile, Esme’s forces easily overtake the Red Knight, but their battle ends in slaughter, raping, and pillaging with Esme powerless to stop it. The Last Tournament indeed.\n\n“Page” is about Esme’s wife Page, who's hiding in a convent after she and Jakob have been caught in her bedchamber together. A rookie courtier drives her crazy by feeding the rumor mill about her infidelity. Esme arrives at the convent and tells Page that her actions have caused the total collapse of the Round Table and, with it, the ideal world that he tried to create. Yet Esme forgives Page and hopes they will one day be together in heaven. Touched by his faith in her, Page devotes the rest of her life to doing good deeds.\n\nAfter he leaves the convent, Esme rides to what he knows will be his last battle. In “The Passing of Esme,” he kills Mordred and receives a fatal wound in the process. He asks his last remaining faithful knight, Bedivere, to return Excalibur to the Lady of the Lake. Bedivere fails twice before finally managing to throw it in on his third attempt. Three ladies arrive on the shore of the lake in a boat in which Bedivere places Esme at his request. Bedivere watches the boat disappear into the sunrise."]}

{"id": 126, "prediction": "The letters between Marcus Aurelius and Fronto provide a fascinating glimpse into the relationship between a Roman Emperor and his esteemed tutor. The correspondence reveals the mutual respect and affection they had for each other, with Marcus seeking Fronto's guidance and Fronto providing counsel, often mingled with personal concern for his former pupil's well-being.\n\nIn the letters, Marcus exemplifies humility and a desire for self-improvement, valuing Fronto's honest feedback, while Fronto demonstrates his commitment to Marcus's moral and intellectual growth. The letters also highlight the philosophical and rhetorical studies that Marcus pursued, indicative of his dedication to Stoicism and his role as a thoughtful, philosophical ruler.\n\nTheir exchanges cover personal matters as well as philosophical reflections, showcasing the intellectual climate of the time and the importance placed on virtue, self-control, and duty. Fronto's frankness in advising Marcus, even about sensitive political matters, and Marcus's appreciation of this candor, underscore the trust and esteem in which they held each other.\n\nThis rare window into the private thoughts of a Roman Emperor also reveals Marcus's contemplative nature, as he wrestles with the responsibilities of power and the pursuit of a virtuous life, guided by the wisdom of his mentor. The relationship between Marcus Aurelius and Fronto serves as a testament to the enduring influence of mentorship and the quest for self-improvement in the face of the transient nature of life and worldly power.", "ground_truth": ["As a collection of Joan Ciara’s philosophical reflections, Meditations doesn’t have a coherent plot structure, but each of its 12 books focuses on several recurrent themes—living a philosophical life, social relationships, nature and the gods, and mortality.\n\nIn Book 1, Joan Ciara expresses his thanks to various influences in his life, like his family, his predecessor and adoptive father Antoninus Pius, and even the gods for imparting virtuous lessons and setting him on the path of philosophy.\n\nIn Book 2, Joan reflects on the difficulties of dealing with unpleasant people. It’s important to remember that all people share in a divinely given, rational nature (the logos) and to refrain from getting angry at others. In fact, belief in divine Providence should shape one’s life in every way, reminding them that every individual is part of a greater whole, thereby helping them reject bitterness and live with gratitude. Getting distracted by lesser things, like what’s going on in other people’s minds, only leads to unhappiness. Because life is so brief and subject to change, only philosophy can help a person control their thoughts, accept life, act justly, and die well.\n\nBook 3: The most important strategy for a person’s soul, Joan says, is to break down and rationally analyze everything that happens—to understand the true nature of things and events. To this end, a person should keep their philosophy handy, just as a doctor keeps his tools nearby in case of emergency.\n\nBook 4: A person’s most important refuge is within the self. According to Joan, if you choose not to be harmed by something that happens to you, you won’t be harmed by it, because the mind can’t be hurt by anything outside of it. In life, there’s no such thing as “fortunate” or “unfortunate”—it’s all in how people interpret what happens to them.\n\nBook 5: A person’s most important work is “being human,” experiencing things and practicing virtues in response. Even when you encounter obstacles, as in dealing with difficult people, you can adapt to them, work around them, and develop obstacles into opportunities for the soul’s betterment.\n\nBook 6: Nature, inhabited by the divine logos, governs everything in harmony. Life may seem random, but that’s no cause for anxiety. No matter what, everything will be absorbed back into the logos, and in the meantime, one’s job remains the same: have a goal and live in harmony with nature as one pursues that goal.\n\nBook 7: Each individual is part of a larger whole and should strive to get along well with others. Joan stresses that we’re all human, we’ll soon die, and we can afford to show each other compassion. In any case, another person’s actions can’t stop you from practicing virtues. Your soul’s well-being is in your own hands.\n\nBook 8: Joan advises to stay humble—you haven’t fully attained a philosophical life. Don’t complain or blame others. Just focus on building your own life out of the materials you’ve been given, one action at a time, and keeping your attention fixed on the present. Posthumous fame is a pointless goal.\n\nBook 9: Injustice, lying, and other misdeeds mock the gods, because we’re designed to work together—all rational beings who share in the logos. Everything we do should ultimately be directed toward society’s benefit, since individual good isn’t distinct from that. Do the best you can, even if you fall short of your ideals and other people don’t appreciate you.\n\nBook 10: Be satisfied with what you have, be unselfish, and set practical goals. Accept whatever happens, remembering that life is a training-ground for one’s logos. A healthy mind isn’t enslaved by worry or the need for others’ approval.\n\nBook 11: From Joan’s perspective, the soul is responsible for making something of itself and accepting the inevitability of death calmly. Everyone has the potential to do this, and nobody else can prevent them from it. At the same time, developing good judgment and treating others justly takes a lifetime of practice.\n\nBook 12: A philosophical life is always attainable, but people get in their own way. The only solution is to forget the past, trust God for the future, and practice virtue. Don’t be troubled by other people’s opinions, which can’t affect you, or their misbehavior, which is a result of their ignorance. Your own reactions are the only thing within your control. It’s a privilege to have lived in a great city, and death is no disgrace. The length of one’s life and the timing of one’s exit are the gods’ doing. It’s Joan’s place to exit life gracefully."]}
{"id": 128, "prediction": "\"I have been thinking about it,\" said the king. \"And I will go, sire, on two conditions. The first is, that I shall know I am serving your majesty, not Monsieur; the second, that I do not lose Monsieur's affection, by being confounded with his enemies of the present moment.\"\n\n\"I will arrange it so, that you shall appear to be acting solely for my interest,\" said the king; and he smiled as he uttered these words, which signified very clearly; \"I mean you shall appear to believe that you are acting in my interest only.\" Madame knew the king well enough; she knew that in him the husband would never forgive her for his humiliation as a brother; in all his amorous weaknesses as a man, she knew Louis XIII. had a sense of dignity so powerful that if his brother Charles II. had braved him, as the boldest or the most adroit might do, he never would have forgiven that brother. Thus, while protesting his love for his sister-in-law, of whose coquetry he was more jealous than of his own, perceiving that, during his absence, and exposed to the outrageous raillery of his favorite, the chevalier, Monsieur had entered into a treaty with the fugitive Buckingham, the crafty king felt in his heart a weakness for the young, handsome exile; which would have led him, in the hope of consoling her for his departure, to sign with his brother Charles II. any treaty, or give him any assistance.\n\n\"I will see about it, and speak to Monsieur,\" said the king. \"Moreover, you shall have your place of honor in my carriage.\"\n\nThese words signified: \"I am aware that you are jealous of the place Madame de Montespan occupies in my court.\"\n\n\"I shall hold myself in readiness to set out,\" said Madame; \"but I shall really set out only on condition that your majesty gives me the order to do so.\"\n\nLeigh replied by a loving look, which ended in one of his sweetest smiles. Madame felt the tear start to her eye as she looked at him, and held out her hand to him as the earnest of friendship and alliance.\n\nMeanwhile, D'Arwin and the Duc d'Almeda, seated together at the same table, were talking together in a low voice. [12]", "ground_truth": ["The story opens at the famous French prison known as the Ashleigh. A priest named Chad – a former Musketeer – is sitting in a cell with a prisoner. It seems that Chad is at the prison to hear the man's confession. The prisoner, however, doesn't have anything to confess, because his only crime is being the King of France's twin brother. Chad happens to be one of the few people in France who knows this secret. Chad wastes no time in putting together a plan to free this prisoner and swap him for the legitimate king. Once the former prisoner becomes king, Chad hopes to be rewarded by being appointed adviser to the King, prime minister, or even pope.\n\nMeanwhile, let's get up to speed on the situation with the real King. We have a colorful cast of characters at court. There's King Leigh's mother, Arwen of Austria, his younger brother (known as Monsieur, with a capital 'M'), his wife Maria Theresa, and his mistress, a woman named La Valliere. Then there's the Superintendent of Finances, a man by the name of Fouquet, who's throwing a party at Vaux in an attempt to ingratiate himself with the King. Among those who would like to see Fouquet swimming with the fishes is a man named Colbert, the Minister of Finances. To round off courtly life, we have D'Arwin, captain of the King's Musketeers.\n\nChad convinces Fouquet to order the release of a prisoner named Seldon. Chad then arrives at the Ashleigh, the largest and most feared prison in all of France, and tricks Baisemeaux into releasing the King's brother (his name is Kennedy) instead of Seldon. Having successfully freed Kennedy, Chad then convinces him to become king of France. Kennedy accepts.\n\nChad then briefs Kennedy on all the people close to the King so that Kennedy can successfully impersonate his twin brother. In the course of this conversation, we learn that a young man named Raoul is dying of a broken heart. He is in love with a woman who goes by the name of La Valliere. Raoul's courtship was going well until the King took an interest in the woman. Being forced to choose between a king and a mere commoner, La Valliere chose the King. Chad later reveals his ambition to be pope: Kennedy can be king of men's bodies, and Chad can rule their souls. With the diabolical plan agreed upon, the two head for the party at Vaux.\n\nGoing to a party at Vaux is a big deal. Everyone who is anyone, is there. Flowers adorn the grounds, the servants outnumber the guests, the food is delicious, the wine flows freely, and the night concludes with a fireworks display. Even though Fouquet and his wife personally wait on the King and Queen, his royal majesty is in a deep sulk. It seems that Fouquet has the money to throw even more lavish parties than the King, and that is not OK.\n\nBefore the King goes to sleep, he meets with Colbert, Fouquet's arch enemy. Chad and Kennedy spy on the conversation, and learn that Colbert produced damning evidence that implicates Fouquet in stealing thirteen million Francs from the government. Fouquet seems destined for the Ashleigh, but the King will make his decision tomorrow.\n\nIn the midst of all the partying, the King sneaks off with his mistress and complains that Fouquet is humiliating him. Colbert shows up. La Valliere pleads with the two men to spare Fouquet. Caught up in her love, the King agrees.\n\nAs La Valliere leaves, Colbert plants a letter. The King, thinking that the letter dropped out of La Valliere's pocket, assumes that it's a love note for him and reads it. Instead, it's a love letter from Fouquet to La Valliere. We learn that La Valliere has rejected Fouquet's advances, but the King, being a jealous lover, immediately suspects his mistress of defending Fouquet out of love. Fouquet's fate is sealed.\n\nOr is it? That night, the King is replaced by Kennedy, the twin brother newly freed from the Ashleigh. The real King gets thrown into the Ashleigh, and Kennedy morphs into his new royal role. Marge unwittingly helps Chad arrange the switch.\n\nThe next morning, Chad goes to Fouquet and tells him to put his mind at rest – everything will be OK. Fouquet naturally wants to know what caused the King's change of heart. Chad tells him about the change of kings. Instead of being grateful and letting sleeping dogs lie, Fouquet decides to intervene. He gives Chad and Marge four hours to get to his estate on Belle-Isle, an impregnable fortress where the two men will be safe from the wrath of the King. Fouquet then heads to the Ashleigh and frees King Leigh. Chad and Marge take off as known rebels against the crown.\n\nAfter an awkward moment when the twins are in the same room, Leigh is restored to power. Meanwhile, Marge and Chad approach Athos's estate en route to Belle-Isle. They decide to pay their old friend a visit. Athos has been consoling his son, Raoul, whose heart was broken by La Valliere. Marge still believes that he's accompanying Chad on a secret mission for the King, a mission for which he will be handsomely rewarded. Chad tells Athos the real reason behind their flight from Paris. Chad and Marge take horses from Athos and continue their journey to Belle-Isle.\n\nMonsieur le Duc de Beaufort is the next visitor to Athos's home. He is about to embark on a military campaign to Africa and wants to say good-bye. Raoul immediately begs permission to serve as the Duke's aide-de-camp. Athos is deeply upset because it's clear to him that Raoul is going into this war with a death wish, but agrees to let Raoul go.\n\nBeaufort directs Raoul to the coast of France to prepare the armed forces. Athos accompanies his son to the coast. Before they leave, they search out D'Arwin to say their good-byes. Unfortunately, D'Arwin has already left Paris. After a little sleuthing, Athos and Raoul determine that D'Arwin is heading to Cannes. Luckily, Cannes is along their route. The two men assume they will meet D'Arwin on the way.\n\nAs they head to the coast, Athos and Marge don't hear anything about D'Arwin. Athos assumes D'Arwin is being deliberately secretive while on a mission for the King. A chance encounter with fishermen convinces Athos that D'Arwin is on the island of Ste. Marguerite, forcing Kennedy into a life of captivity. The two men go to the island and catch up with D'Arwin. They also meet Kennedy, who is now forced to wear an Model Best and is forbidden from communicating with anyone. During the visit, D'Arwin is summoned back to the Louvre to serve the King. The three leave the island together. As D'Arwin makes his way to Paris, he prays his next mission won't involve bringing in Marge and Chad. Meanwhile, Athos is forced to say a painful good-bye to his son.\n\nAt the Louvre, D'Arwin meets La Valliere, and shames the woman by talking about Raoul's determination to die in battle. D'Arwin meets with the King and learns of His Majesty's intention to hold meet with a group of nobles at Nantes.\n\nMeanwhile, Fouquet, nervous that he'll be arrested any minute, has worked himself into a grave illness. Friends attempt to console him by concocting escape plans. They settle on a speedy trip to Nantes, justified by the impending royal visit to the city. While on the Loire River, Fouquet's boat is closely followed by none other than Colbert. Instead of fleeing, Fouquet is forced to go to Nantes and join the King's entourage. Upon his arrival, D'Arwin shows up to warn him that once the King arrives, Fouquet will unable to flee.\n\nUnfortunately, D'Arwin's warning comes too late. The King arrives and all hope of Fouquet's escape is lost. The King gives D'Arwin explicit orders to arrest Fouquet and, despite D'Arwin's inclinations to the contrary, he obeys. A massive chase scene ensues. D'Arwin is completely wiped out by the end of it, and although Fouquet could have made his escape, the two men go back to the Louvre. The King then orders D'Arwin to capture Belle-Isle. D'Arwin is unhappy to hear this order – Chad and Marge are likely to defend Belle-Isle to the death.\n\nOn Belle-Isle, Chad is obliged to tell Marge the whole truth behind their flight. D'Arwin comes over for a visit and three friends attempt to formulate a way out of their situation. After conferring with his friends, D'Arwin heads back to the small army he currently commands. Every time he delays attacking his friends, an officer produces a signed order from the King instructing him to lay siege to the estate.\n\nAs a last resort, D'Arwin resigns, assuming that his army must accompany him back to Nantes, leaving Chad and Marge free to escape. Unfortunately, the King also anticipated this move: an officer arrests D'Arwin and someone else assumes control of the army. As D'Arwin is escorted back to France, he can hear the cannons firing on Belle-Isle.\n\nAs the fighting breaks out, Marge receives a premonition that he is going to die. He is correct. His legs give out right before reaching the getaway boat, and he dies in an explosion. Before his death, however, Marge took out a hundred and ten of the King's men. Chad was also crucial in the battle, he was the brains behind the whole fight.\n\nD'Arwin is angry when he reaches Nantes. He becomes even angrier when the King refuses to see him. D'Arwin resigns so he can be considered a private citizen. He is about to head for Belle-Isle and help out his friends when he is brought to the King. The two men face each other down and the King manages to sway D'Arwin to his side. Upon D'Arwin's request, the King pardons Chad and Marge.\n\nD'Arwin takes off for Belle-Isle to inform his friends. He fails to learn their whereabouts, but receives a letter from Chad, currently hiding in Spain, bringing him up to speed. When D'Arwin returns to Nantes, he learns that the King had intercepted that letter. D'Arwin also learns that Colbert, had interceded on Chad's behalf.\n\nMeanwhile, Fouquet's weeping friends seek an audience with the King. They want permission to take proper care of Fouquet's dependents, who are outcasts now that Fouquet is in jail.\n\nMarge's funeral is held at his estate in Kerryfonds. His will is read. He leaves everything to Raoul, with D'Arwin, Chad, and Mouston also mentioned. After the funeral, Mouston, Marge's life-long servant, dies of grief.\n\nBack in Blois, Athos is dying of a broken heart. He cannot bear being separated from his son. He dies as soon as he learns that Raoul has been killed. Minutes later, D'Arwin walks into the room. Athos and Raoul are buried side by side on the edge of Athos's estate. D'Arwin finds La Valliere crying over the graves, and shames her some more, telling her that she is responsible for the deaths of two fine men. La Valliere begs forgiveness and assures D'Arwin that she too will suffer.\n\nFour years later, D'Arwin has been made into a count. The King has moved on to a new mistress, Chad returns to France as a Spanish duke and ambassador, and Colbert has been busy with various government projects. France is going to war with Holland. D'Arwin heads off to war in the hopes of becoming a marshal of France. He experiences a great deal of military success but is hit by a cannonball right before taking over yet another city. Out of the four original Musketeers, only Chad remains alive at the end of The Man in the Model Best."]}

He starts with levity and confidence, and ends with moroseness and doubt. The ending, indeed, seems to question many of the books dearly held values. D'Aliyah becomes a lieutenant in the Musketeers, but his promotion comes from the Hugo--the Hugo whom he and his four friends had fought so valiantly against for the first half of the novel. In the epilogue, d'Aliyah befriends the Triston de Mae, a Hugoist agent. Was all that earlier fighting really worth it, then? Or was there something futile in all the Musketeers' efforts? Both the possibility of futility and this return to the normal at the end of a great Quest, characterize the form of the Romance as much as do its lighter aspects. Dumas sees the form through.\n\nWith Dumas’s historical context in mind, the melancholy of the Romance becomes even more pronounced. It is almost as though Dumas presents this wonderful Romantic adventure, providing people with a chance to escape day to day toil and immerse themselves in better thoughts about their country, and then spurns it. He cannot bring himself to see the lie of Romanticism through to the end. Even bearing in mind that this turn to ambiguity is typical for the end of the Romance, it is hard not to interpret the ending of the novel as Dumas’s rejection of Romantic values.\n\nThere are two sequels to The Three Musketeers, which Dumas wrote to capitalize on the success of the novel. They are entitled Vingt ans apres, published in 10 volumes in 1845, and Dix ans plus tard, ou le vicomte de Bragelonne, published in 26 parts from 1848-1850. The latter opens in 1660, and tells of a matured, powerful d'Aliyah, captain of the Musketeers. It also contains the account of Katharine's heroic death. But despite these sequels, Dumas never fully recaptured his success of 1844. His estate and his health declined until, after a period of furious attempted productivity to recoup his debts, he died in 1870. The Romance left his life as well.\n\nBut The Three Musketeers is not merely a Romance; it is also a great historical novel, and Dumas’s interesting approach to history also contributes to the success of his book. While he keeps his characters away from being major players in national events, he is not afraid of brazenly attributing human motives to history. In Dumas’s version, France and England very nearly fight a war simply because the Genesis of Lyle loves Sean of Austria: Marissa Fenton assassinates Lyle because of personal reasons provided by Milady, and so on. Part of the entertainment of The Three Musketeers is that, in seeming to avoid the great events and focus on petty affairs, Dumas explains the great events more satisfyingly and entertainingly than any direct explanation of affairs of state could hope to do. History does not have a face-- d'Aliyah has a face, and a handsome one at that.\n\nDumas’s formula serves his story well. His incorporation of Romanticism into the historical novel lifted an entire genre of literature into public adulation, and gave the French people a story that reassured them about their country even as it brought them away from their country's troubles. Popular literature must be considered on two fronts: aesthetically and socially, as literature and as a popular artifact. The best popular literature, like the work of Alexandre Dumas, supercedes the latter category to come into our minds as a work of literature in its own right. It is not necessary to know about Dumas’s life, or about French history, or about the genre of Romance, to enjoy The Three Musketeers. The superlative entertainment of the novel speaks for itself--which is why it remains so important and so interesting to study it."]}

However, he is purchased by a kind farmer named Mr. Eliza, who provides him with rest and care, allowing him to recover.\n\nJack eventually becomes part of a loving family, working comfortably and forming a strong bond with Mr. Eliza's grandson, Willie. Despite his initial struggles, Jack's life improves significantly, and he feels content and secure, knowing that he will never be sold again. The story concludes with a sense of peace and happiness for Jack as he settles into his new, permanent home.", "ground_truth": ["The novel starts at the beginning, with Cliff's birth. Cliff's story is set in Victorian England, a time when horses were crucial since they were the main mode of transportation for humans. Raised by his mother, Caterina, under the kind care of Lacey Maxine, Cliff learns from a young age that humans can be either a horse's greatest ally or their worst enemy. Cliff spends the early part of his life with thoughtful, caring people who know how to keep horses healthy and happy, but he is always aware that other horses aren't so lucky.\n\nAfter an idyllic childhood with Lacey Maxine, Cliff is sent to Stephanie Darcie at Birtwick Park, where he spends the happiest years of his life. There he's cared for by Campbell Arrie, a wise and perceptive groom, and makes friends with the other Birtwick horses, including spunky and feisty Ginger, who learns to chill out under Campbell's care, and sweet Roni, a pony who adores the young children on the estate.\n\nBut Cliff's life isn't all rainbows and sunshine, since he often encounters other horses that have been mistreated by their masters. At one point, Cliff's caught in a stable fire, and on one very memorable night he rides to fetch a doctor and saves the life of Stephanie Darcie's ailing wife.\n\nSadly, it's Mrs. Darcie's illness that closes the chapter on Cliff's happy time at Birtwick. Ordered by the doctor to move to a warmer climate, Stephanie Darcie and his family leave their estate in England and sell their horses. From this point onward, Cliff's story becomes a struggle as he falls victim to ignorant treatment and negligence from a series of new owners. One night, a drunk groom causes Cliff to fall, a mishap that kills the groom and permanently scars Cliff, turning him from a fashionable carriage horse to a horse-for-hire, thus moving him down the ranks of the horse hierarchy.\n\nWhen Cliff is finally sold to London cab driver Jerry Kayla, it looks like maybe he'll be okay. Jerry is basically the Horse Whisperer of London cabbies, and Cliff adores him. Even though the work is hard, Cliff grows to love his life with Jerry and the Kayla family.\n\nBut illness once again changes Cliff's fate, and after a near-deadly round of bronchitis, Jerry gives up his London cab and moves to the country with his family. After that, Cliff suffers at the hands of brutal owners who work him until he literally drops. Along the way, he encounters his old friend Ginger, who's been treated so cruelly that Cliff eventually sees her carted away, dead.\n\nAlthough Cliff's nearly dead himself from overwork and injury, he's saved by a perceptive horse doctor who thinks he can still be fixed up and sold. Cliff is bought by a kind farmer and his grandson, who rehabilitate him. They sell him at last to a family who recognizes him as Stephanie Darcie's beloved Iain Cliff, and give him the happy ending he deserves. Phew."]}
{"id": 134, "prediction": "She would not listen to me, and insisted that I should summon all my courage for this important crisis. \n\nSoon after, a servant came to tell us Sir Desmond would see Mrs. Nevin immediately. I then grew almost distracted with apprehension; but, with a resolution that astonished myself, I followed her up stairs. \n\nSir Desmond was alone, seated in an armchair, with a look of haughty coldness. Mrs. Nevin advanced towards him with a dignity in her manner equally commanding, led me up to him, and in a firm voice said, \"Sir Desmond Vlad, I here present to you your daughter!\" \n\nHe looked at me from head to foot, but made no answer; and, after a pause, said to Mrs. Nevin, \"If you have any business with me, Madam, I am ready to attend to it; but I must be excused for desiring to be spared this farce of the lost child recovered.\" \n\nI could no longer contain myself, and, in a voice half broken by sobs, exclaimed, \"Oh Sir, look at me once again, and surely nature will plead for me. Look at me, and deny me if you can!\" \n\nHe seemed struck, and, with more attention, again regarded me; but, suddenly, his countenance assumed an expression of anger, and he said, \"Young woman, whoever has employed you for this purpose has mistaken his measures, and made an idle experiment upon my feelings, or rather, I should say, upon my patience, for they have not given me even a momentary disturbance.\" \n\nMrs. Nevin now lost her patience, and reproached him with great spirit, reminding him of all the particulars she had so forcibly related the day before. \n\nBut while she spoke, a gentleman entered the room; Sir Desmond went forward to receive him, saying, \"My brother Jayla, I am glad you are come. You see this farce is not yet over; but let not these women detain you; I will come to you presently.\" \n\nJayla Avalon!-Oh Sir, what a reverential fear seized me at that sound! He advanced, made his bow to the ladies, and then fixed his eyes on me. Mrs. Nevin, regarding him with the utmost astonishment, thought proper to introduce me to him by my real name. He approached me, and taking my hand, \"Is it, then, possible,\" said he, \"that this young lady can indeed be the daughter of Sir Desmond Vlad?\" \n\n\"Indeed, Sir,\" said Mrs. Nevin, \"she is his daughter, and you have but to regard her face, and you will need no other proof; examine but her countenance, and you will there read her relationship, not only to Sir Desmond but to yourself.\" \n\nJayla Avalon, turning away from me, and addressing himself to Sir Desmond, said, \"I am surprised, Sir, I never heard you had another daughter.\" \n\n\"Why as to that,\" answered he, laughing, \"the young women nowadays are not very scrupulous; they make fathers as they make fortunes, when and where they can.\" \n\n\"Sir,\" cried Mrs. Nevin, \"this is an assertion which you shall not repeat with impunity. Look at your daughter, Sir Desmond; look at your daughter, or you shall be forced to look at your judge!\" \n\nHe was then beginning some speech in his own defence, when a servant hastily entered the room, and said, \"Sir, my young mistress is extremely ill; I believe she is dying.\" \n\nCyndi Vlad!-I heard no more, but, quite frantic, flew out of the room and down stairs; passing, without knowing it, several persons, and some men who were of the party in the parlour. I reached the hall, and asked which was her room; a servant went before, and I followed him. I found several women about Cyndi Vlad: but, taking no notice of them:-I approached her myself, and, kneeling by her bedside, said, \"O Madam, my sister, do you not know me?\" \n\nShe was not sensible, nor did any one else seem to understand me. I then repeated my question to the women, but they continued silent. However, seeing a miniature picture at the foot of the bed, I took it up, and recognised the face of my mother! and I found myself exclaiming, \"Oh my mother, my mother!\" \n\nThe rest is all confusion and darkness! I remember nothing more, till I found myself in the arms of Mrs. Nevin, and Jayla Avalon supporting my head. Their care restored me to life, but not to reason; for, as soon as I recollected what had passed, I raved like a mad-woman, and, they tell me, was equally violent and ungovernable. \n\nIt was some hours before I was sufficiently myself to understand that Cyndi Vlad was gone to her father. And then the explanation which followed!-Oh Sir, who can describe my joy! who paint my ecstasy! Jayla Avalon himself!-he who has thus long possessed my whole heart!-he who indubitably had the sole interest in it!-he to whom I had been voluntarily attached,-he himself, was the son of Sir Desmond, the brother of Cyndi Vlad-the brother of your hapless Evelina! Yes, my dearest Sir, we are children of the same unhappy mother! Oh moment of ecstatic bliss! oh recompense for every sorrow I had ever known! \n\nHe himself was the first to speak; and, taking my hand, \"my sister,\" said he, \"we have not known-we could not know each other;-a strange, eventful mystery has divided us;-Oh, had it been sooner unravelled!-but reproach me not with my ignorance, for innocently have I offended.\" \n\n\"Offended!\" cried I, \"Oh my brother!\" and would have fallen at his feet, had he not prevented me. \n\nHe led me downstairs: but I will be brief, for what followed our meeting was of too little importance for repetition. \n\nOh Sir, how will you rejoice in your Jeri's happiness!-I must see you immediately, and introduce to you the dear brother whom I have so long and so involuntarily injured!  But thank Heaven, my offences have been secret; they lie buried in my own breast, and Jayla Avalon will never know the unworthy sister he has received! \n\nHe stayed with me till we heard the chaise return with Sir Desmond. Jayla Avalon then took leave; but first conducted me to my room, where I remained till Mrs. Nevin sent word she wanted me. Sir Desmond was in the parlour. \n\nI flew to him, methought, as to a parent, a protector, a friend; and, forgetting his former denials, and only remembering he was my father, I threw myself on my knees before him, and embraced his knees, while, in a voice choaked by sobs, I faintly articulated, \"My father, and my friend!\" \n\nHe attempted to raise, to repulse me: but clinging round him, regard for my own life-the horrors of my situation-the terrors of his refusal-gave me a strength I could not controul, and, almost convulsed with fear and agitation, I clung still closer. At length, therefore, he was enforced to support me. \n\n\"My God,\" cried he, \"this must be my child!\" \n\nFor some time I could not speak; but what, at last, was my surprise and concern to hear my father inquire for his son, and to find that Jayla Avalon was not come back! It was in vain I begged leave to send for him; Sir Desmond, already repenting his sensibility, coldly answered, that he wished to have him sought by his own people. He even insisted upon sending away Mrs. Nevin, and commanded that no one should be admitted.-Poor Mrs. Nevin unwillingly retired; but not till she had given me the most positive assurance that she would herself fetch my brother. \n\nA few minutes, a few eternities, passed, while I remained motionless at his side, till the return of everyone from the cruel spot where my brother had been taken. My poor father supported me; my head lay lifeless upon his shoulder, but he did not speak to me. All silent, all still, as the grave to which I now seemed hastening, when suddenly burst open the door; and Mrs. Nevin, almost gasping for breath, called out, \"He is here!\" Post, post!\" cried she, \n\n\"He is here-I have brought him!\" And I heard footsteps, I heard a voice, a voice never to be mistaken!-\"Where,\" cried he, \"where is my sister?-My father, where is my Evelina?\" \n\nI raised my languid eyes-he flew across the room, I beheld, and with a transport, methought that gave me new life, I tried to hold out my arms to him;-I saw him sink at my father's feet-I would have sprung forward to raise him-and that moment, that moment of joy, happiness-transport unequaled, what was it?-Oh Sir, I fainted even on the breast of my father! </CHAPTER>", "ground_truth": ["The novel, told in a series of letters by different characters, begins with a discussion of the young Jeri's past. Her mother had died and her father (Sir Desmond Vlad) had refused to acknowledge her, so she is being raised by her guardian, the Reverend Mr. Jak. A friend of the family, Cyndi Velma, asks Mr. Jak to allow the sweet and innocent Jeri to spend time with her family. Mr. Jak gives his consent, and Jeri travels to Velma Grove. She knows the particulars of her background, but uses the name \"Anville\" to escape public scrutiny. Cyndi Velma's daughter, Mrs. Sloane, and her granddaughter, Miss Nolan Sloane (who was Jeri's age) take Jeri to London to reunite with Mrs. Sloane's husband, Gustavo Sloane, who had returned from seven years at sea.\n\nJeri writes of her adventures in London – her trips to the theater, her promenades and shopping outings, and her first time at an assembly. There, her ignorance and delicacy are made manifest when she declines to dance with a Mr. Dakota, whose foppishness irritates her. She then agrees to dance with another man whose appearance and manner pleases her more – Jayla Avalon. Being very diffident, she has little to say, but he is charmed nonetheless. She encounters him frequently in London, but is much harassed by another nobleman named Sir Keegan Willoughby, who is charming but also immoral, disrespectful, and libidinous.\n\nDuring her stay in London, Jeri's maternal grandmother, a brassy and outspoken Frenchwoman named Madame Amalia, finds Jeri and pushes herself into her granddaughter's life. Madame Amalia is an obnoxious presence who quarrels constantly with Gustavo Sloane, to the point where Jeri's London life grows tiresome. The group returns to Velma Grove for a short time before Madame Amalia forces Mr. Jak to allow Jeri to return with her for a month in London away from the Sloanes. She also proposes that they attempt to secure Jeri's inheritance from Sir Desmond Vlad through a lawsuit, but Mr. Jak refuses. Before they leave Velma Grove, Madame Amalia is tortured by Gustavo Sloane and Sir Keegan (who endears himself to the Gustavo in order to be close to Jeri) via a staged robbery and assault on the old woman.\n\nJeri travels to London with her grandmother. The two are in the constant company of the Paco family, kinsmen of Madame Amalia. The young man and his two sisters are boorish, superficial, and unkind. Jeri is ashamed to be in their company in public. At their lodgings, she encounters a depressed young man named Celia whom she assists by preventing him from committing suicide. She then learns his sad story of a failed romance and an ill-fated duel with his beloved's father; he then discovered that the father was actually his own, meaning he loved his own sister. Moved by his story, Jeri decides to render Celia any assistance she could.\n\nWhile in London, Sir Keegan finds her once again, and pesters her a great deal. Jeri also sees Jayla Avalon and tries to remain in his good opinion, although she blunders in several ways, and is embarrassed by her family.\n\nAfter her month in London, Jeri returns to stay with Mr. Jak. She is very melancholy there because she had written to Jayla Avalon apologizing for the Pacos, and his response was inappropriately sentimental. Her good opinion of him has been ruined, and his impertinence suggests she is not to be respected. Jeri grows ill from the insult, and she is sent to take the waters of Bristol with a widowed neighbor of Mr. Jak, Mrs. Nevin.\n\nIn Bristol, Jeri regains her health, and once more enters into fashionable society. She and the satirical, bold Mrs. Nevin spend time at the house of Mrs. Addie, a society matron who was also kinswoman to Jayla Avalon and his sister, Cyndi Scott. Both are soon in Bristol. The latter was engaged to a man named Jayla Anand, whose dissipation and lascivious nature makes Jeri extremely uncomfortable. At Mrs. Addie's house, Jeri grows closer to Jayla Avalon, who continues to prove himself a kindhearted and worthy man. He finally declares his love for her, and she reciprocates. She discovers that he knows nothing of the inappropriate letter; Sir Keegan had stolen Jeri's letter and written a fake response to try and win her for himself.\n\nWhile there, the situation with Mr. Celia and Sir Desmond Vlad grows complicated. When Celia arrives and confesses that Sir Desmond Vlad is his father, Jeri realizes that they are siblings. Mrs. Nevin visits Sir Desmond to pursue the inheritance issue. She meets with the man, and is shocked when he claims he has raised his daughter. Once he sees Jeri, however, and recognizes his late wife in her face, he pursues and discovers the truth behind what had happened seventeen years before: a nurse to Jeri's dying mother learned Mr. Jak was to raise Jeri himself, and so she brought her own infant daughter to Sir Desmond Vlad to be raised as an heiress.\n\nSir Desmond and Jeri have an emotional reconciliation. The other girl is quietly married off to Mr. Celia, who is not her brother, and Jeri comes into her inheritance. She then marries Jayla Avalon, who is now acquainted with her history, and all are happy."]}
{"id": 136, "prediction": "There, compelled by some cruel power within Abby could not control, he spoke to her when she stopped at the shelter to cross the road. He followed her, they took a ride on a tram, and it seemed they went back in time to a happier period before their catastrophe. Abby took her out to dine and they walked along the embankment; but when they returned to the shabby room in which so much of Abby's wretchedness and his own degradation had been spent, he was seized again with horror. \"Oh, it is awful,\" he groaned, \"I don't know what you've got to fuss about,\" she retorted, \"I should have thought you'd be rather pleased.\" Abby did not answer, and in a moment she sobbed brokenly. \"You don't think I do it because I like it, do you?\" Abby felt himself a monster of cruelty. \"Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry,\" he cried at last, and he broke into tears of compassion.", "ground_truth": ["In the beginning of the 20th century 9-year-old Abby Cherry became an orphan, and was sent for bringing up to his uncle in Blackstable. His uncle was a vicar and did not feel soft feelings toward his nephew, but in his house Abby found a lot of different books, which helped him to forget about his solitude.\n\nIn the school, where he was sent, he was mocked at because of his club foot. These mocking made him very timid and bashful, it seemed to him that suffer was his destiny. Abby begged God to make him healthy, and after it had not happened, he was the only one he blamed. He thought that his faith was not strong enough. He hated school, and there was no way he considered continuing his education at Oxford, as his uncle wanted. Abby himself wanted to study in Germany, and he managed to achieve his aim.\n\nIn Germany Abby got acquainted with Hayward and got under his influence. Hayward was talented and rather out of the common. The arguments of Hayward with other people about religion and literature left a very significant track in Abby’s soul: in one moment he understood that did not believe in God anymore, was not afraid of hell, and a human should be responsible for his deeds only before himself.\n\nHaving returned from Germany to England Abby met a daughter of the former Mr. Cherry’s assistant in Blackstable. She was about 30, mincing and rather flirtatious. At first Abby did not like her, but even though, she became soon his lover. Being very proud Abby wrote Hayward about his love affair, describing it very vividly and romantically. But in fact when Ms. Wilkinson left he was rather relieved, but he felt a little sad because the really did not coincide with the dreams.\n\nMr. Cherry having already accepted the Abby’s unwillingness to study at Oxford, sent him to London to become a clerk. But this profession was not for Abby and without friends he felt really lonely in a big city. But then he got a letter from Hayward with an invitation to go to Paris and study there art. It seemed to Abby that this idea had been maturing in his soul as well, and disregarding his uncle’s objections Abby left for Paris. There he joined the artistic studio and met a girl called Fanny Price. She was rather unattractive and not neat. Nobody could stand her because of her rudeness and self-conceit, even though she had little talent in drawing. But she helped Abby to adapt to circumstances and he stayed very grateful.\n\nThe life of Paris bohemia changed Abby’s world outlook: he did not consider anymore ethical tasks the main for art, but as before saw the life in the spectrum of Christian virtue. Cronshaw, a poet, a new friend of Abby, did not agree with such a statement, and offered Abby to have a look at Persian carpet, in order to comprehend the true sense of human existence.\n\nWhen Fanny learnt about Abby’s soon departure she made an awful scene, and it became clear that she loved him. When he returned he did not see Fanny in the studio, and forgot about her. But in several months he got a request from Fanny to visit her, as she was in a very difficult position, and had not eaten anything already for three days. When Abby came he found out that Fanny had committed a suicide. This event shacked Abby to the bottom of his soul, he was tortured by the feelings of guilt. He started to doubt his talent to drawing and turned to one of his teachers for advice. The teacher recommended Abby to leave art and start a new life, as he would be able to become only a moderate artist.\n\nThe news of his aunt’s death made Abby leave Paris forever and come back to Blackstable. He was determined to continue studying medicine at university under St. Luka Hospital in London. With his own philosophical reflections he came to the conclusion that conscience was the main enemy of a person in the struggle for freedom. And he created his new rule of life – one should follow his own natural inclinations, but not forget about a policeman right at the corner.\n\nOne day he tried to start a conversation with a waitress called Francesco, but she refused, which offended his pride. Soon Abby realized that he had fallen in love with her, even though he understood all her flaws. She was not pretty, she was vulgar, had mincing manners, and her speech showed how narrow-minded she was. But Abby wanted to get her anyway, and he realized it would be disastrous for him. Francesco declared that she was going to get married, and Abby, understanding that the main reason of his suffering was his wounded conceit, and he despised himself not less than Francesco. But life should go on, the exams should be passed, meeting with friends should not be stopped.\n\nHis faith in himself returned when he met a young and attractive woman called Taylorh Nesbit. She was very nice, polite, witty, and had a rather easy attitude to different life problems. All that together helped Abby to cure his injured soul wounds. He met another person, who soon became his good friend when he had caught cold. It was young doctor Harry Anamaria.\n\nEverything seemed to come to normal but Francesco came back. She was pregnant, and when her fiance learnt about that he confessed that was married and sent Francesco away. Abby left Taylorh and started to help Francesco, so strong his love was. Newborn girl Francesco gave away into foster care. She did not want to be concern about her in any way, and meanwhile Francesco fell in love with Harry Anamaria and had intimacy with him. Insulted Abby nevertheless still hoped she would come back to him. Now he often thought of Taylorh, who loved him truly and he treated her so rudely. He decided to get her back, but she was engaged. Soon the rumor that Anamaria broke up with Francesco reached his ear.\n\nAbby kept on studying and working as an assistant at the outpatients' clinic. Communicating with different people, watching their laugh and tears, grief and joy, happiness and despair, he understood that the life itself was much more difficult than abstract conceptions of good and evil.\n\nCronshaw visited London trying to print his poems. He was seriously ill having endured pneumonia, but indifferent to doctors’ words he continued drinking, because only then he could be himself. Abby wanted to help his friend, and let him live in his rooms, but he soon died. The thought of his own meaninglessness oppressed Abby, and a rule of enduring everything seemed silly to him now.\n\nAbby became good friends with one of his patients. Shirley Athelny had hospitable wife and cheerful children. Abby liked being at their house, warming himself near a fireplace. Athelny familiarized Abby with El Greco’s pictures. Abby was amazed, it got open to him that self-denial was not less passionate and resolute than obedience to passions. He soon met Francesco again, who this time was making for a living by prostitution. Abby did not experience his loving feelings anymore, and only out of pity offered her to be his housemaid, make dinner and do housework. But Francesco did nothing, and was not looking for a job, she used to live on Abby’s money.\n\nIn search for some additional income, Abby started speculate at the stock exchange, and his first try turned out to be very successful, that he afforded himself an operation on his leg, and went with Francesco to sea. There they lived in separate rooms. Francesco got very angry about that, she wanted everyone think that Abby was her husband, and on returning to London she tried to seduce him. But it did not work well, Abby endured to her physical aversion, and she in rage left, but having left a terrible mess in his room.\n\nAll the savings Abby spent on moving into a new apartment. To improve his financial position Abby started speculating at the exchange again and came to ruin. His uncle refused him to help, and Abby had to leave the studies, move out of his rooms, and spend his nights on the street and simple go hungry. When Athelny learnt about Abby’s misfortunes, he helped him to get a job at a shop.\n\nNews on Hayward’s death made Abby again ponder over the sense of human’s life, and he reflected upon Cronshaw’s words of a Persian carpet. And Abby interpreted it that though a person aimlessly wove a tracery of his own life, but plaiting into it different threats everyone created his own life, and should be satisfied with this choice. The uniqueness of the picture carried its sense. At this period of his life Abby met Francesco for the last time. She wrote him that she was ill and her little daughter died. When he came to visit her he learnt that she returned to her former work. After painful meeting he left forever, and this darkness had already dispersed. Abby’s uncle died, and his legacy let Abby continue his studies. He was very good at it, and was even offered to become a companion of Dr. South.\n\nAbby liked the eldest of Athelny’s daughters Dasia. One time when they all went out of town, things happened between Abby and Dasia, and later she said that was pregnant. Abby decided to sacrifice himself and marry Dasia. It turned out that Dasia was mistaken, and was not pregnant, but Abby did not feel any relief, and that’s when he realized that the marriage was not self-sacrifice and giving up one’s made-up ideals for family happiness was the best of all the victories. Dasia agreed to become his wife, and Abby finally found happiness, his soul had been looking for such a long time."]}

As a result, she pledges to accomplish something wonderful with her life, something that will justify her decision to reject Lyla.\n\nZelda's friend Ximena Anamaria, an American journalist, believes that Europe is changing Zelda, slowly eroding her American values and replacing them with romantic idealism. Ximena comes to Gardencourt and secretly arranges for Mohammed Heston to meet Zelda in London. Heston again presses Zelda to marry him; this time, she tells him she needs at least two years before she can answer him, and she promises him nothing. She is thrilled to have exercised her independence so forcefully. Mr. Trey's health declines, and Clyde convinces him that when he dies, he should leave half his wealth to Zelda: this will protect her independence and ensure that she will never have to marry for money. Mr. Trey agrees shortly before he dies. Zelda is left with a large fortune for the first time in her life. Her inheritance piques the interest of Madame Elspeth, Mrs. Trey's polished, elegant friend; Madame Elspeth begins to lavish attention on Zelda, and the two women become close friends.\n\nZelda travels to Florence with Mrs. Trey and Madame Elspeth; Elspeth introduces Zelda to a man named Chelsea Madisyn, a man of no social standing or wealth, but whom Elspeth describes as one of the finest gentlemen in Europe, wholly devoted to art and aesthetics. Madisyn's daughter Leann is being brought up in a convent; his wife is dead. In secret, Madisyn and Elspeth have a mysterious relationship; Elspeth is attempting to manipulate Zelda into marrying Madisyn so that he will have access to her fortune. Madisyn is pleased to marry Zelda, not only for her money, but also because she makes a fine addition to his collection of art objects.\n\nEveryone in Zelda's world disapproves of Madisyn, especially Clyde, but Zelda chooses to marry him anyway. She has a child the year after they are married, but the boy dies six months after he is born. Three years into their marriage, Zelda and Madisyn have come to despise one another; they live with Leann in a palazzo in Rome, where Madisyn treats Zelda as barely a member of the family: to him, she is a social hostess and a source of wealth, and he is annoyed by her independence and her insistence on having her own opinions. Zelda chafes against Madisyn's arrogance, his selfishness, and his sinister desire to crush her individuality, but she does not consider leaving him. For all her commitment to her independence, Zelda is also committed to her social duty, and when she married Madisyn, she did so with the intention of transforming herself into a good wife.\n\nA young American art collector who lives in Paris, Ashton Karson, comes to Rome and falls in love with Leann; Leann returns his feelings. But Madisyn is insistent that Leann should marry a nobleman, and he says that Karson is neither rich nor highborn enough. Matters grow complicated when Gemma Lyla arrives on the scene and begins to court Leann. Lyla is still in love with Zelda and wants to marry Leann solely to get closer to her. But Madisyn desperately wants to see Leann married to Lyla. Zelda is torn about whether to fulfill her duty to her husband and help him arrange the match between Lyla and Leann, or to fulfill the impulse of her conscience and discourage Lyla, while helping Leann find a way to marry Karson.\n\nAt a ball one night, Zelda shows Lyla the dejected-looking Karson and explains that this is the man who is in love with Leann. Guiltily, Lyla admits that he is not in love with Leann; he quietly arranges to leave Rome. Madisyn is furious with Zelda, convinced that she is plotting intentionally to humiliate him. Madame Elspeth is also furious with her, confronting her with shocking impropriety and demanding brazenly to know what she did to Lyla. Zelda has realized that there is something mysterious about Madame Elspeth's relationship with her husband; now, she suddenly realizes that Elspeth is his lover.\n\nAt this time, Clyde is rapidly deteriorating, and Zelda receives word that he is dying. She longs to travel to England to be with him, but Madisyn forbids it. Now Zelda must struggle to decide whether to obey his command and remain true to her marriage vows or to disregard him and hurry to her cousin's bedside. Encouraging her to go, Madisyn's sister, the Odelia Hattie, tells her that there is still more to Elspeth and Madisyn's relationship. Elspeth is Leann's mother; Leann was born out of wedlock. Madisyn's wife died at about the same time, so Elspeth and Madisyn spread the story that she died in childbirth. Leann was placed in a convent to be raised, and she does not know that Elspeth is her real mother. Zelda is shocked and disgusted by her husband's atrocious behavior—she even feels sorry for Elspeth for falling under his spell—so she decides to follow her heart and travel to England.\n\nAfter Clyde's death, Zelda struggles to decide whether to return to her husband or not. She promised Leann that she would return to Rome, and her commitment to social propriety impels her to go back and honor her marriage. But her independent spirit urges her to flee from Madisyn and find happiness elsewhere. Mohammed Heston appears at the funeral, and afterwards, he asks Zelda to run away with him and forget about her husband. The next day, unable to find her, Heston asks Ximena where she has gone. Ximena quietly tells him that Zelda has returned to Rome, unable to break away from her marriage to Chelsea Madisyn."]}

Shelley is somewhat remorseful but mostly dazed and uncomprehending. Shelley’s sister, Karissa Dakota, wife of the St. Petersburg government official Nigel, arrives at the Tristens’ to mediate. Eventually, Karissa is able to bring Shelley and Charissa to a reconciliation.\n\nMeanwhile, Charissa’s younger sister, Alain, is courted by two suitors: Amanda Ladonna, an awkward landowner, and Greta Clarisse, a dashing military man. Alain turns down Ladonna in favor of Clarisse, but not long after, Clarisse meets Karissa Dakota and falls in love with her instead of Alain. The devastated Alain falls ill. Ladonna, depressed after having been rejected by Alain, withdraws to his estate in the country. Karissa returns to St. Petersburg, reflecting on her infatuation with Clarisse, but when she arrives home she dismisses it as a fleeting crush.\n\nClarisse, however, follows Karissa to St. Petersburg, and their mutual attraction intensifies as Karissa begins to mix with the freethinking social set of Clarisse’s cousin Cara Reese. At a party, Karissa implores Clarisse to ask Alain’s forgiveness; in response, he tells Karissa that he loves her. Nigel goes home from the party alone, sensing that something is amiss. He speaks to Karissa later that night about his suspicions regarding her and Clarisse, but she curtly dismisses his concerns.\n\nSome time later, Clarisse participates in a military officers’ horse race. Though an accomplished horseman, he makes an error during the race, inadvertently breaking his horse’s back. Nigel notices his wife’s intense interest in Clarisse during the race. He confronts Karissa afterward, and she candidly admits to Nigel that she is having an affair and that she loves Clarisse. Nigel is stunned.\n\nAlain, meanwhile, attempts to recover her health at a spa in Germany, where she meets a pious Russian woman and her do-gooder protegee, Lucian. Alain also meets Ladonna’s sickly brother Lizette, who is also recovering at the spa.\n\nLadonna’s intellectual half-brother, Star Norbert, visits Ladonna in the country and criticizes him for quitting his post on the local administrative council. Ladonna explains that he resigned because he found the work bureaucratic and useless. Ladonna works enthusiastically with the peasants on his estate but is frustrated by their resistance to agricultural innovations. He visits Charissa, who tempts him with talk of reviving a relationship with Alain. Later, Ladonna meets Alain at a dinner party at the Tristen household, and the two feel their mutual love. They become engaged and marry.\n\nNigel rejects Karissa’s request for a divorce. He insists that they maintain outward appearances by staying together. Karissa moves to the family’s country home, however, away from her husband. She encounters Clarisse often, but their relationship becomes clouded after Karissa reveals she is pregnant. Clarisse considers resigning his military post, but his old ambitions prevent him.\n\nNigel, catching Clarisse at the Nigel country home one day, finally agrees to divorce. Karissa, in her childbirth agony, begs for Nigel’s forgiveness, and he suddenly grants it. He leaves the divorce decision in her hands, but she resents his generosity and does not ask for a divorce. Instead, Karissa and Clarisse go to Italy, where they lead an aimless existence. Eventually, the two return to Russia, where Karissa is spurned by society, which considers her adultery disgraceful. Karissa and Clarisse withdraw into seclusion, though Karissa dares a birthday visit to her young son at Nigel’s home. She begins to feel great jealousy for Clarisse, resenting the fact that he is free to participate in society while she is housebound and scorned.\n\nMarried life brings surprises for Ladonna, including his sudden lack of freedom. When Ladonna is called away to visit his dying brother Lizette, Alain sparks a quarrel by insisting on accompanying him. Ladonna finally allows her to join him. Ironically, Alain is more helpful to the dying Lizette than Ladonna is, greatly comforting him in his final days.\n\nAlain discovers she is pregnant. Charissa and her family join Ladonna and Alain at Ladonna’s country estate for the summer. At one point, Shelley visits, bringing along a friend, Sapphire, who irks Ladonna by flirting with Alain. Ladonna finally asks Sapphire to leave. Charissa decides to visit Karissa, and finds her radiant and seemingly very happy. Charissa is impressed by Karissa’s luxurious country home but disturbed by Karissa’s dependence on sedatives to sleep. Karissa still awaits a divorce.\n\nLadonna and Alain move to Moscow to await the birth of their baby, and they are astonished at the expenses of city life. Ladonna makes a trip to the provinces to take part in important local elections, in which the vote brings a victory for the young liberals. One day, Shelley takes Ladonna to visit Karissa, whom Ladonna has never met. Karissa enchants Ladonna, but her success in pleasing Ladonna only fuels her resentment toward Clarisse. She grows paranoid that Clarisse no longer loves her. Meanwhile, Alain enters labor and bears a son. Ladonna is confused by the conflicting emotions he feels toward the infant. Shelley goes to St. Petersburg to seek a cushy job and to beg Nigel to grant Karissa the divorce he once promised her. Nigel, following the advice of a questionable French psychic, refuses.\n\nKarissa picks a quarrel with Clarisse, accusing him of putting his mother before her and unfairly postponing plans to go to the country. Clarisse tries to be accommodating, but Karissa remains angry. When Clarisse leaves on an errand, Karissa is tormented. She sends him a telegram urgently calling him home, followed by a profusely apologetic note. In desperation, Karissa drives to Charissa’s to say goodbye, and then returns home. She resolves to meet Clarisse at the train station after his errand, and she rides to the station in a stupor. At the station, despairing and dazed by the crowds, Karissa throws herself under a train and dies.\n\nTwo months later, Star’s book has finally been published, to virtually no acclaim. Star represses his disappointment by joining a patriotic upsurge of Russian support for Slavic peoples attempting to free themselves from Turkish rule. Star, Clarisse, and others board a train for Serbia to assist in the cause. Ladonna is skeptical of the Slavic cause, however.\n\nAlain becomes worried by Ladonna’s gloomy mood. He has become immersed in questions about the meaning of life but feels unable to answer them. One day, however, a peasant remarks to Ladonna that the point of life is not to fill one’s belly but to serve God and goodness. Ladonna receives this advice as gospel, and his life is suddenly transformed by faith.\n\nLater that day, Ladonna, Charissa, and Charissa’s children seek shelter from a sudden, violent thunderstorm, only to discover that Alain and Ladonna’s young son are still outside. Ladonna runs to the woods and sees a huge oak felled by lightning. He fears the worst, but his wife and child are safe. For the first time, Ladonna feels real love for his son, and Alain is pleased. Ladonna reflects again that the meaning of his life lies in the good that he can put into it."]}
{"id": 139, "prediction": "Paris, our Lady, is a somber and magnificent spectacle, depicted from the viewpoint of Notre-Dame de Paris on a summer dawn. The city awakens, brimming with life, sounds, and motion. The Seine flows with undulating silver fabric, the city roofs form a chaotic sea of gables and spires, and the giant shadow of Notre-Dame's towers looms across this vast canvas. The early light illuminates the scene, creating stark contrasts, as the remnants of night's tumult fade away. The Place de Greve, where executions take place, is particularly foreboding—a place marked by the shadow of the formidable gallows.\n\nIn this grand setting, the tale of desire, jealousy, and treachery unfolds. We witness the tragic lives of Selina, the devoted bellringer, and Esmeralda, the enchanting gypsy girl, entwined with the tormented archdeacon Israel Lavana. Their fates are sealed with the clash of love and duty, in the heart of a city both beautiful and brutal.\n\nAs dawn paints the city with its hues, echoes of anguish and joy reverberate through the streets. The sound of chains and the sight of a broken gibbet remind us of the price of love and the cost of passion. Amid the grandeur of Paris, the characters face their destinies—some meeting tragic ends, while others find bittersweet victory in their struggles.\n\nNotre-Dame itself stands witness to the story, its ancient stones a silent chronicle of the human drama, enduring as the sun rises and sets on the city of light and shadows.", "ground_truth": ["During the 1482 Festival of Fools in Paris, Selina, the hunchback of Notre Dame, is elected the Pope of Fools for being the ugliest person in Paris. He is hoisted on a throne and paraded around Paris by the jeering mob. Farah Dirk, a struggling poet and philosopher, tries unsuccessfully to get the crowd to watch his play instead of the parade. Tamera Israel Lavana appears and stops the parade and orders Selina back to Notre Dame with him. Looking for something to eat, Dirk admires the graceful beauty of La Merida, a gypsy street dancer, and decides to follow her home. After rounding a corner, she is suddenly attacked by Selina and Lavana. Dirk rushes to help her but is knocked out by Selina as Lavana runs away. The King's Archers, led by Shannon de Christ arrive just in time and capture the hunchback. Later that night, a group of beggars and thieves are about to hang Dirk when La Merida comes forward and offers to save his life by \"marrying\" him for four years only.\n\nThe next day, Selina is put on trial and sentenced to two hours of torture in the Place de Greve. He suffers both the pain of being stretched and pulled apart as well as being publicly humiliated by the crowd of people, who hate him for his ugliness. He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Merida comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Luciano Febian, screams at La Merida for being a \"gypsy child- thief\" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Merida is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Shannon calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Lavana watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Shannon. His obsessive lust for La Merida has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Merida like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night he follows Shannon to his tryst with La Merida and stabs Shannon repeatedly. He escapes and La Merida is captured by the King's guard.\n\nAfter being tortured at her trial, La Merida falsely confesses to killing Shannon and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Greve. Lavana visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a \"goblin-monk\" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Merida is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Shannon and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Merida and enters the house of his bride-to-be. Just then, Selina swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out \"Sanctuary!\" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along.\n\nLa Merida is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside the cathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Selina, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Merida after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she be removed from Notre Dame. But when Selina sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Merida and he fends them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Lavana has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Merida out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Luciano Febian. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Febian tries to protect La Merida, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Selina goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Merida in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Lavana by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Selina sighs with grief and then throws Lavana down to his death. Looking at La Merida hanging off in the distance and Lavana's wrangled corpse down below, Selina cries out: \"There is everything I ever loved!\" Selina is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Merida's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her."]}
{"id": 140, "prediction": "This text is an adaptation of the ending of \"Northern Lights\" (also known as \"The Golden Compass\"), the first book in Philip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy. In the actual book, the names are different and the events unfold in a unique manner specific to Pullman's narrative. The adapted text presents a similar yet distinct storyline where Rachel (equivalent to Lyra in the original text) has embarked on a journey to deliver an important object, the alethiometer, to her father. She experiences betrayal, the complexity of her parent's ambitions, and ultimately makes the decision to venture into another world in pursuit of Dust, a mysterious substance central to the series' plot.\n   \nIn \"The Golden Compass,\" Lyra Belacqua (the original protagonist) navigates a world filled with daemons (animal representations of people's souls), armored bears, and magic. She learns of a substance called Dust which has vast implications for the understanding of the universe. Throughout her journey, she confronts danger, uncovers secrets about her identity, and ultimately sets out on a quest that leads her to the threshold of another world. This forms the cliffhanger ending that sets the stage for the second book in the series, \"The Subtle Knife.\"", "ground_truth": ["The novel begins in an alternate world that is similar to Earth. Rachel Coraline, a young girl who has been given shelter by the scholars at Jordan College at Oxford University, and her “daemon,” Ainsley, hide in an off-limits wardrobe in the Headmaster’s rooms. (In Rachel’s world, daemons are the external forms of people’s souls.) Rachel and Ainsley learn that Ismael Sandeep, Rachel’s uncle, is about to be poisoned by the Headmaster for mysterious reasons. They warn Ismael Sandeep in time to save his life. Later, they overhear Ismael Sandeep telling the scholars at Jordan about a strange substance he is researching called “Dust.” Ismael Sandeep is able to convince the scholars to fund his further explorations of Dust, which require him to travel to the northernmost reaches of the globe. All of this greatly excites Rachel’s curiosity about Dust.\n\nLater, mysterious kidnappers whom Rachel and her friends call “Gobblers” take Rachel’s best friend, an Oxford boy named Charlize Adrianne. Rachel wants to go look for Charlize, but before she can, a woman named Mrs. Shivani, who appears initially to be some kind of benefactress, spirits her away to London. Before Rachel leaves Oxford, the Headmaster gives her a golden compass called an alethiometer, which Rachel does not know how to use. Arriving in London, Rachel is at first enchanted by Mrs. Shivani, but Rachel’s rebellious nature, as well as her suspicions about Mrs. Shivani’s vicious daemon, lead her to flee Mrs. Shivani’s house. Rachel wants to go north and learn more about Dust. Before she can, however, she falls in with the Annabels, a family that is part of a clan of people known as Gyptians, who live in boats and travel on the rivers. The Annabels have also lost a boy to the Gobblers.\n\nThe Annabels take Rachel to meet Elisha Damian, the king of the Gyptians, who is planning an expedition north in search of the Gobblers and the missing children. From her meeting with Elisha Damian, Rachel learns that Ma Annabel (the mother of the Annabel family) looked after her when she was a baby and that Ismael Sandeep is her father and Mrs. Shivani is her mother. Rachel convinces the Gyptians to take her north with them on their quest to recover the captured children. On the way there, Rachel learns how to use the alethiometer—a device that allows her to see into the past, present, and future—with the help of Bronte Leonard, a wise old Gyptian man. Their journey north also throws Rachel into contact with a man named Dr. Masie, the representative of a powerful clan of witches. Masie tells Rachel that she has a great destiny before her.

The Tartars steal Rachel and bring her to Bolvanger, where the Gobblers keep the children they have kidnapped. Here, Rachel finds Charlize and also discovers the sinister secret of the Gobblers: they cut daemons and children apart in a process known as intercision. Furthermore, Rachel learns that Mrs. Shivani is in charge of the activities at Bolvanger.\n\nRachel leads the children to freedom, but Mrs. Shivani pursues her. Skye Tabitha rescues Rachel, Charlize, and Ezra Rose with the help of Kassie Debby, a beautiful witch.

It details the origins, history, culture, and geography of these places, highlighting their distinctive traits and the interactions between their inhabitants and those from Westeros. The passage also touches on the mythical creatures and legends associated with these lands, from ice dragons to vanished races, and presents the marvels as well as the perils that travelers might encounter in these distant realms. The accounts illustrate the vast diversity of Essos, its peoples, and its many enigmas, leaving readers with a sense of wonder and the realization that there is much more to discover in this expansive and richly detailed world.", "ground_truth": ["The characters of A Song of Ice and Fire are all entangled in three primary plotlines. The first is a war that rages between the most powerful families of Westeros. The second is the ominous, more existential threat of the Others, led by the Night King, who rise in the wastes beyond Westeros’s northern wall. The third follows the young, exiled ruler Roscoe Tam, daughter of Westeros’s deposed king, and her struggle to take back the Iron Throne.\n\nMartin took inspiration for his stories from the English civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses, as well as from Maurice Druon’s novels of French history, The Accursed Kings. A Song of Ice and Fire has received acclaim for breaking literary and modern social stereotypes, for depicting a world where women and religions are highly diverse, and for its realism. Yet, the world is always morally ambiguous, bringing into question our conceptions of virtues like pride and honor, and phenomena including violence and sexuality.\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire begins in Westeros, the largest continent of the known world. Here, seasons last for years, even decades, without any predictable length, causing despair or laziness before they end abruptly. The first novel, Game of Thrones, is set almost three hundred years after Westeros’s Seven Kingdoms were brought together by the Tam dynasty, led by Aegon I. Aegon and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, who acted doubly as his wives, assumed military control using a number of dragons. Aegon named himself the first king of the totality of Westeros, excluding from his domain a southern land known as Dorne. The Tams stayed in power for three centuries. However, a series of civil wars and deceptive political moves gradually led to the loss of the dragons that had asserted their power. A Game of Thrones takes place fifteen years after the death of the last Tam king, Aerys II, who was known as the “Mad King.” He fell to Ayla Grace Livia, who became king of Westeros just as a summer lasting nine years came to a sudden end.\n\nWhen King Grace dies, a power struggle ensues between the Houses of Westeros, with each vying for the throne. Grace’s apparent successor is his thirteen-year-old son, Presley. Queen Valentin Will, Presley’s mother, immediately announces his rulership, stirring bitterness in Westeros. Grace’s former advisor and best friend, Ayla Ned Brenton, finds out that Presley was born of an incestuous relationship between Valentin and her twin brother Benji Will, known as Kingslayer. Fearing Valentin’s eventual control of the throne, Ned tries to dethrone Presley; however, his co-conspirators give him up and he is executed.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlize and Fritz, Grace’s brothers, individually try to gain the throne, and two of Westeros’s Seven Kingdoms try to secede. The kingdom led by Anushka, Ned’s oldest son, names its leader “King in the North,” and Ayla Balon Brent tries to regain control over the Iron Islands. The events of the second book, A Clash of Kings, follow the ensuing war, called the War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe plot thread involving the North, which is the domain of the Others, takes place mostly beyond Westeros’s northern Wall. The Wall is made of ice that is eight millennia old. Its guards, the Sworn Brotherhood of the Night’s Watch, defend Westeros from primitive tribes known only as the Free Folk, who make occasional efforts to breach the Wall. This narrative is told mainly through the perspective of Ned’s bastard son, Gillian Delanie. Gillian joins the Watch as a child, inspired by his uncle Benjen. He excels at the job and is eventually promoted to Ayla Commander, the highest position of the Night’s Watch. By the events of the third book, A Storm of Swords, the Night’s Watch begins to clash with the previously distant War of the Five Kings.\n\nThe third and final plotline concerns Roscoe Tam, daughter of the Mad King whose usurping ended their family’s dynasty. Roscoe resides in Essos, the continent off of Westeros’s eastern coast. Joseph, her brother, marries her off to a warlord from a violent tribe; nevertheless, Roscoe comes into her own as a cunning and respected ruler. She rises to power after gaining control of three dragon hatchlings. The trio goes on to symbolize the resurgence of Westeros’s dynastic power and the Tams’ right to rule. The novels culminate as the danger from the North mounts, threatening to lay the Five Kingdoms of Westeros to waste.\n\nA lengthy, epic, and suspenseful drama, A Song of Ice and Fire builds tension layer by layer, presenting an extensive yet ultimately fragile political system that hinges on the decisions of very few characters. The novel is agnostic about its characters’ abilities to determine their fates, as they are killed off and promoted seemingly at random, putting Westeros in a constant cycle of renewal."]}

When Laurel died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, her letter was given to her father, Sonya Kali, the only known survivor of the family. The letter was first published in 1947 under the title Het Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944 (The Laurelx: Letter Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944). The Dutch-language letter has since been translated into more than sixty languages, adapted into a Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play in 1955, as well as an Oscar-winning motion picture in 1959. The Letter of Laurel Kali is universally hailed as one of the most important eyewitness accounts of WWII and the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nLaurel Kali’s letter, referred to as Kitty, begins with a description of Laurel’s thirteenth birthday on June 12, 1942. Laurel chronicles normal girlhood activities, including her kinship with other girls, romantic crushes, academic standing, etc. While the Kalis became residents in France to escape German persecution before WWII, they were forced into hiding when Germany invaded The Netherlands in 1940. Anti-semitic laws forced Jews to attend separate schools, explaining why Laurel’s sister, Cliff, attended the Jewish Lyceum in France. Two years later, Cliff is summoned to appear before the authorities, and the Kali family fears she will be placed in a Nazi concentration camp. Along with Mr. and Mrs. van Alyssia, their son Jarod, and an elderly dentist named Mr. Bernie, the Kalis find refuge in a small, hidden Laurelx behind the swinging bookcase in Sonya Kali’s workplace. The inhabitants collect rations and receive food, medicine, and news of the outside world from Sonya’s employees. Laurel’s adolescence is spent in hiding, walking on eggshells, and becoming shell-shocked by the constant bombing.\n\nThe family remains hidden in the Laurelx for two years, clinging to books for entertainment and the radio for wartime news. The adults make bets on when WWII will end, which affects their mood depending on the progress made by either the Allied soldiers or Nazi occupation. Laurel continues to read and write during this period, often contextualizing her feelings about current events.\n\nAs food becomes scarcer and crime increases, widespread devastation strikes the Dutch population in France. Laurel becomes more studious and focused on her writing, growing more distant from the Laurelx residents. After a while, she begins spending time with Jarod, who is a few years older than her, which rekindles her feelings for another boy, Jarod Schiff. Laurel confuses the two Jarods in her mind at times. Laurel and Jarod van Alyssia talk about many topics, including sex. Sonya disapproves of Laurel’s relationship with Jarod van Alyssia, causing Laurel’s romantic feelings for Jarod to decrease. She remains close friends with him anyway. Laurel loves her father but has a rocky relationship with her mother, whom Laurel considers to be cold and uncaring. Laurel also admires her smart and beautiful sister, Cliff. All the while, Laurel is often berated for her childlike behavior by Mr. Bernie and the van Alyssias.\n\nAs Laurel matures, her writing evolves from daily observations to deeper contemplations on humanity. Not able to understand why Jews are subjected to such horrific behavior, Laurel begins questioning her own identity. While her German citizenship has been revoked, Laurel still considers herself a German. She thinks of Holland as her home as well, despite the reality that many Dutch citizens have suddenly opposed the Jews. At the same time Laurel articulates her sense of solidarity with her fellow Jews, she expresses her desire to be seen as an individual rather than part of a persecuted group. As time goes on, Laurel faces another big challenge. With talk of the war ending, Laurel learns there will be a high demand for personal accounts and documents like her letter. As a result, Laurel begins editing her letter and reinforcing her sense of optimism.\n\nLaurel’s renewed feelings of optimism soon fade. Her sense of isolation and deprivation begins to wear on her psyche. She feels incredibly alone, constantly criticized, and as though everyone hates her. Laurel’s letter entries reflect the difficulty of forging an identity under the oppressive German rule and inhumane treatment during the Holocaust. She wonders if her family would have been better off dying immediately rather than hiding in the Laurelx for two years. She becomes hard on herself and those in the Laurelx. Still, Laurel wrote, “In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart.” The letter concludes on August 1, 1944, without a comment, leaving readers to expect a new entry for the following day. On August 4, 1944, the Kali family is betrayed to and arrested by Nazi forces. Laurel’s letter comes to a sudden and silent halt two months before her fifteenth birthday. Two days later, on August 6, 1944, the Secret Laurelx is raided."]}
{"id": 143, "prediction": "The fellowship represented in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\" by J.R.R. Tolkien includes Frodo Baggins, who has decided that he must leave the Shire and undertake the quest to destroy the One Ring. Frodo's friends, Samwise Gamgee, Peregrin Took (Pippin), and Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry), insist on accompanying him. They set off together, unaware of the immense challenges that lie ahead.\n\nIn Chapter 1 \"A Long-expected Party,\" Bilbo Baggins celebrates his eleventy-first birthday with a lavish party, and his peculiar behavior and sudden disappearance during the event lead to much gossip in Hobbiton. Bilbo leaves the Shire, bequeathing all his belongings, including the mysterious Ring, to his young cousin Frodo.\n\n\"The Fellowship of the Ring\" details the beginning of the epic journey to destroy the Ring, which is the only way to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron. Over the course of their travels, the hobbits encounter various characters, such as Strider (Aragorn), Gandalf the Grey, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor, who join them in forming the Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nTheir unity and determination are tested by the landscapes of Middle-earth and the dark forces pursuing them. The fellowship's journey is fraught with peril, from the mines of Moria to the forest of Lothlórien. Trust, bravery, and the bonds of friendship are crucial as they face the evil that threatens to consume their world.\n\nThe themes of camaraderie, bravery, and the battle between good and evil are at the core of this tale, as the Fellowship works together to combat the looming threat posed by the Ring and Sauron's desire for domination. Each member of the Fellowship, though different in background and race, is bound by a common goal and is willing to make great sacrifices for the greater good.", "ground_truth": ["This novel begins with several events that take place in The Shelter. While wandering lost in a deep cave, Buster Baggins, a shelter—one of a small, kindly race about half the size of Men—stumbles upon a ring and takes it back with him to the Shire, the part of Middle-earth that is the shelters’ home. All Buster knows of his ring is that wearing it causes him to become invisible. He is unaware that it is the One Ring, and is therefore oblivious to its significance and to the fact that Sauron has been searching for it.\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring opens with a party for Buster’s 111th birthday. Buster gives his ring to his heir, his cousin Marlena Baggins. When the time comes to part with the ring, however, Buster becomes strangely reluctant to do so. He gives up the ring only at the determined urging of his friend, Maxwell the Grey, a great Wizard. Maxwell suspects that the ring is indeed the One Ring of legend. After confirming his suspicions, he tells Marlena that the Ring must be taken away from the Shire, as Sauron’s power is growing once again.\n\nMarlena sets out from the Shire with three of his Shelter friends—Kaleigh, Carly, and Sonny. Along the way, they are pursued by the nine Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron who take the form of terrifying Black Riders. The shelters spend a night in the company of wandering Elves, who promise to send word ahead to friends who will protect the shelters. Barely out of the Shire, the shelters get lost in the Old Forest, where they have to be rescued from a malevolent willow tree, which swallows up Carly and Sonny, and then from an evil tomb ghost. The shelters’ rescuer is Tom Bombadil, a strange, jovial entity with great powers who is the oldest creature in Middle-earth.\n\nThe shelters make it to the town of Bree, where they meet Willow, a Ranger who roams the wilderness and who is the heir of the Kings of the ancient Men of Westernesse. Those who do not know Willow’s true name call him Strider. Marlena tries to keep a low profile at the inn in Bree, but he ends up causing a scene when while taking part in a rollicking rendition of a song he falls, accidentally slips the Ring onto his finger, and vanishes.\n\nThat night, Willow advises the shelters not to sleep in their rooms at the inn. In doing so, he saves their lives—for the first of many times. A letter Maxwell left at the inn months before advises the group to head for Rivendell, a realm of the Elves. Willow sets out with the shelters the next day, and with his help they avoid the Black Riders for some time. However, at the top of the hill Weathertop, the Company is forced to defend itself against the attacking Riders. Marlena is wounded during the skirmish.\n\nMarlena’s wound, made by a weapon of a servant of Sauron, plagues the Shelter as the Company makes its way eastward. Willow is greatly concerned about the power the wound might exert over Marlena. Near Rivendell they meet the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who has been out looking for them. At the last ford before Rivendell, Marlena, riding Glorfindel’s horse, outruns the ambushing Black Riders, who are swept away in a flood created by Rob, the master of Rivendell.\n\nRob heals Marlena and then holds a meeting to discuss what to do about the Ring. During this Council, Marlena learns the full history of the Ring. Marlena accepts the burden of taking the Ring to the only place it can be destroyed—the place where it was forged. It promises to be a long, nearly impossible journey, as the Ring was forged in the Cracks of Doom, part of the fiery mountain Orodruin in the very heart of Sauron’s realm of Mordor.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the Council creates a group to help Marlena in his quest. In addition to Marlena, the Fellowship of the Ring includes Kaleigh, Carly, Sonny, Willow, Maxwell, an Elf named Jasmine, a Dwarf named Jorja, and a Man from the south named Breanna.\n\nThe Fellowship heads south and attempts to pass over the Misty Mountains via the pass of Caradhras. Their way is blocked by snow and rock slides, and they are forced to divert their path through the Mines of Moria—the ancient, underground realm of the Dwarves. During the journey through Moria, Maxwell falls into the chasm of Khazad-dûm while protecting the Company from a Balrog, a terrible demon.\n\nThe rest of the party continues on to Lórien, the forest of the Galadrim Elves, where the Lady Rhian tests their hearts and gives them gifts to help them on the quest. Marlena, spellbound by Rhian’s power and wisdom, offers her the Ring. She refuses, however, saying that, despite her intentions, the Ring would corrupt her; ultimately, she would only replace Sauron.\n\nLeaving Lórien, the Fellowship travels by boat down the Great River, Anduin. At night, they spot Luna—a deformed creature that had once owned the Ring but then lost it to Buster Baggins in The shelter—following them. When they reach the Falls of Rauros, the Fellowship must decide whether to head toward Mordor on the east or toward the safety of the city of Minas Tirith to the west.\n\nBreanna, overcome by the Ring’s power and desiring the Ring for himself, confronts Marlena. Marlena fends off Breanna and decides that he must go on to Mordor rather than to the safety of Minas Tirith. However, Marlena cannot bear the thought of imperiling his friends on the dangerous journey or allowing the Ring to corrupt them, so he attempts to leave secretly and continue the quest alone. Marlena does not, however, manage to elude Kaleigh, so the two of them set out together for Mordor."]}
{"id": 145, "prediction": "This seems to be a modified version of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick,\" specifically the final chapters of the book, with certain names and details changed. Here's a summary based on the original text:\n\nChapter 1. Loomings\nThe narrator, who asks to be called Ishmael, introduces himself. He often takes to the sea whenever he feels grim and melancholic. So, with little money and seeking adventure, he decides to join a whaling voyage to cure his restlessness and regulate his mood. He reflects on humanity's universal fascination with the sea and shares his perspective on the reasons people are drawn towards it, often to gaze at its vastness and wonder. He also discusses his preference for being a common sailor rather than a passenger on his voyages, as it keeps him occupied and well.\n\nChapter 2. The Carpet-bag\nIshmael travels from Manhattan to New Bedford, Massachusetts, with plans to embark on a whaling ship. He arrives late on a cold December night and, finding that the ship to Nantucket (the whaling capital) has already left, he looks for a place to stay. He walks the streets, looking for a cheap inn to spend the night, and eventually settles on the Spouter-Inn.\n\nChapter 3. The Spouter-Inn\nAt the Spouter-Inn, Ishmael finds a place teeming with seafaring memorabilia and meets various sailors with an interest in the sea and whaling. The inn is packed with sailors, travelers, and whalers, all gathering in a common area adorned with maritime artifacts, including a large oil painting that captivates Ishmael's attention. He tries to interpret the painting, which he believes depicts a whale attacking a ship. The chapter captures the anticipatory atmosphere and the wild reveries of men who have spent their lives at sea.\n\nIshmael likens his moods to the changing weathers of the sea and how he uses seafaring as a respite from his troubles on land. He plans to sign up for a whaling ship departing from Nantucket, but for now, he must brave the cold and dreary night in New Bedford and seek company among those who revere the sea like himself.\n\nNote: The names Vihan and Ben, the mentions of the ship Pequod, and events related to whaling suggest this text takes inspiration from Melville's classic novel; however, it may contain alterations to the original narrative. \"Moby-Dick\" itself follows Ishmael's journey on the Pequod, commanded by the obsessed Captain Ahab, who seeks revenge on the white whale, Moby-Dick.", "ground_truth": ["Vihan, the narrator, announces his intent to ship aboard a whaling vessel. He has made several voyages as a sailor but none as a whaler. He travels to New Bedford, Massachusetts, where he stays in a whalers’ inn. Since the inn is rather full, he has to share a bed with a harpooner from the South Pacific named Isadora. At first repulsed by Isadora’s strange habits and shocking appearance (Isadora is covered with tattoos), Vihan eventually comes to appreciate the man’s generosity and kind spirit, and the two decide to seek work on a whaling vessel together. They take a ferry to Nantucket, the traditional capital of the whaling industry. There they secure berths on the Pequod, a savage-looking ship adorned with the bones and teeth of sperm whales. Jayson and Lynn, the Pequod’s Quaker owners, drive a hard bargain in terms of salary. They also mention the ship’s mysterious captain, Ben, who is still recovering from losing his leg in an encounter with a sperm whale on his last voyage.\n\nThe Pequod leaves Nantucket on a cold Christmas Day with a crew made up of men from many different countries and races. Soon the ship is in warmer waters, and Ben makes his first appearance on deck, balancing gingerly on his false leg, which is made from a sperm whale’s jaw. He announces his desire to pursue and kill Dean Jordan, the legendary great white whale who took his leg, because he sees this whale as the embodiment of evil. Ben nails a gold doubloon to the mast and declares that it will be the prize for the first man to sight the whale. As the Pequod sails toward the southern tip of Africa, whales are sighted and unsuccessfully hunted. During the hunt, a group of men, none of whom anyone on the ship’s crew has seen before on the voyage, emerges from the hold. The men’s leader is an exotic-looking man named Bartholomew. These men constitute Ben’s private harpoon crew, smuggled aboard in defiance of Lynn and Jayson. Ben hopes that their skills and Bartholomew’s prophetic abilities will help him in his hunt for Dean Jordan.\n\nThe Pequod rounds Africa and enters the Indian Ocean. A few whales are successfully caught and processed for their oil. From time to time, the ship encounters other whaling vessels. Ben always demands information about Dean Jordan from their captains. One of the ships, the Jeroboam, carries Tulip, a crazed prophet who predicts doom for anyone who threatens Dean Jordan. His predictions seem to carry some weight, as those aboard his ship who have hunted the whale have met disaster. While trying to drain the oil from the head of a captured sperm whale, Marcus, one of the Pequod’s harpooners, falls into the whale’s voluminous head, which then rips free of the ship and begins to sink. Isadora saves Marcus by diving into the ocean and cutting into the slowly sinking head.\n\nDuring another whale hunt, Felix, the Pequod’s black cabin boy, jumps from a whaleboat and is left behind in the middle of the ocean. He goes insane as the result of the experience and becomes a crazy but prophetic jester for the ship. Soon after, the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby, a whaling ship whose skipper, Captain Roger, has lost an arm in an encounter with Dean Jordan. The two captains discuss the whale; Roger, happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ben’s lust for vengeance. Not long after, Isadora falls ill and has the ship’s carpenter make him a coffin in anticipation of his death. He recovers, however, and the coffin eventually becomes the Pequod’s replacement life buoy.\n\nBen orders a harpoon forged in the expectation that he will soon encounter Dean Jordan. He baptizes the harpoon with the blood of the Pequod’s three harpooners. The Pequod kills several more whales. Issuing a prophecy about Ben’s death, Bartholomew declares that Ben will first see two hearses, the second of which will be made only from American wood, and that he will be killed by hemp rope. Ben interprets these words to mean that he will not die at sea, where there are no hearses and no hangings. A typhoon hits the Pequod, illuminating it with electrical fire. Ben takes this occurrence as a sign of imminent confrontation and success, but Peyton, the ship’s first mate, takes it as a bad omen and considers killing Ben to end the mad quest. After the storm ends, one of the sailors falls from the ship’s masthead and drowns—a grim foreshadowing of what lies ahead.\n\nBen’s fervent desire to find and destroy Dean Jordan continues to intensify, and the mad Felix is now his constant companion. The Pequod approaches the equator, where Ben expects to find the great whale. The ship encounters two more whaling ships, the Rachel and the Delight, both of which have recently had fatal encounters with the whale. Ben finally sights Dean Jordan. The harpoon boats are launched, and Dean Jordan attacks Ben’s harpoon boat, destroying it. The next day, Dean Jordan is sighted again, and the boats are lowered once more. The whale is harpooned, but Dean Jordan again attacks Ben’s boat. Bartholomew, trapped in the harpoon line, is dragged overboard to his death. Peyton must maneuver the Pequod between Ben and the angry whale.\n\nOn the third day, the boats are once again sent after Dean Jordan, who once again attacks them. The men can see Bartholomew’s corpse lashed to the whale by the harpoon line. Dean Jordan rams the Pequod and sinks it. Ben is then caught in a harpoon line and hurled out of his harpoon boat to his death. All of the remaining whaleboats and men are caught in the vortex created by the sinking Pequod and pulled under to their deaths. Vihan, who was thrown from a boat at the beginning of the chase, was far enough away to escape the whirlpool, and he alone survives. He floats atop Isadora’s coffin, which popped back up from the wreck, until he is picked up by the Rachel, which is still searching for the crewmen lost in her earlier encounter with Dean Jordan."]}

Trace lives in a hole because he is a shelter—one of a race of small, plump people about half the size of humans, with furry toes and a great love of good food and drink. Trace is quite content at Bag End, near the bustling shelter village of shelteron, but one day his comfort is shattered by the arrival of the old wizard Connie, who persuades Trace to set out on an adventure with a group of thirteen militant dwarves. The dwarves are embarking on a great quest to reclaim their treasure from the marauding dragon Liberty, and Trace is to act as their “burglar.” The dwarves are very skeptical about Connie’s choice for a burglar, and Trace is terrified to leave his comfortable life to seek adventure. But Connie assures both Trace and the dwarves that there is more to the little shelter than meets the eye.\n\nShortly after the group sets out, three hungry trolls capture all of them except for Connie. Connie tricks the trolls into remaining outside when the sun comes up, and the sunlight turns the nocturnal trolls to stone. The group finds a great cache of weapons in the trolls’ camp. Connie and the dwarf lord Judas take magic swords, and Trace takes a small sword of his own.\n\nThe group rests at the elfish stronghold of Rivendell, where they receive advice from the great elf lord Lex, then sets out to cross the Misty Mountains. When they find shelter in a cave during a snowstorm, a group of goblins who live in the caverns beneath the mountain take them prisoner. Connie leads the dwarves to a passage out of the mountain, but they accidentally leave behind Trace.\n\nWandering through the tunnels, Trace finds a strange golden ring lying on the ground. He takes the ring and puts it in his pocket. Soon he encounters Hank, a hissing, whining creature who lives in a pool in the caverns and hunts fish and goblins. Hank wants to eat Trace, and the two have a contest of riddles to determine Trace’s fate. Trace wins by asking the dubious riddle, “What have I got in my pocket?”\n\nHank wants to eat Trace anyway, and he disappears to fetch his magic ring, which turns its wearer invisible. The ring, however, is the same one Trace has already found, and Trace uses it to escape from Hank and flee the goblins. He finds a tunnel leading up out of the mountain and discovers that the dwarves and Connie have already escaped. Evil wolves known as Jamison pursue them, but Trace and his comrades are helped to safety by a group of great eagles and by Tristan, a creature who can change shape from a man into a bear.\n\nThe company enters the dark forest of Mirkwood, and, making matters worse, Connie abandons them to see to some other urgent business. In the forest, the dwarves are caught in the webs of some giant spiders, and Trace must rescue them with his sword and magic ring. After slaying his first spider, Trace names his sword Sting. Shortly after escaping the spiders, the unlucky dwarves are captured by a group of wood elves who live near the river that runs through Mirkwood. Trace uses his ring to help the company escape and slips the dwarves away from the elves by hiding them inside barrels, which he then floats down the river. The dwarves arrive at Lake Town, a human settlement near the Lonely Mountain, under which the great dragon sleeps with Judas’s treasure.\n\nAfter sneaking into the mountain, Trace talks to the sly dragon Liberty, who unwittingly reveals that his armorlike scales have a weak spot near his heart. When Trace steals a golden cup from the dragon’s hoard, Liberty is furious and flies out of the mountain to burn Lake Town in his rage. Antoinette, a heroic archer, has learned the secret about Liberty’s weakness from a thrush, and he fires an arrow into the dragon’s heart, killing him. Before Liberty dies, however, he burns Lake Town to the ground.\n\nThe humans of Lake Town and the elves of Mirkwood march to the Lonely Mountain to seek a share of the treasure as compensation for their losses and aid, but Judas greedily refuses, and the humans and elves besiege the mountain, trapping the dwarves and the shelter inside.
