## Introduction

Welcome to InfiniteBench, a cutting-edge benchmark tailored for evaluating the capabilities of language models to process, understand, and reason over super long contexts (100k+ tokens). Long contexts are crucial for enhancing applications with LLMs and achieving high-level interaction. InfiniteBench is designed to push the boundaries of language models by testing them against a context length of 100k+, which is 10 times longer than traditional datasets.

## Features

- **Loooong Context:** InfiniteBench is a pioneer in testing language models with a context length of 100k+, offering an unparalleled challenge in the field.
- **Diverse Domain:** The benchmark comprises 12 unique tasks, each crafted to assess different aspects of language processing and comprehension in extended contexts.
- **Specialized Test:** InfiniteBench consists of tasks that state-of-the-art LLMs are known to be capable of when using shorter context. This ensures that the performance degradation is only caused by the length of the contexts.
- **Real-World and Synthetic Scenarios:** The tasks are a mix of real-world scenarios and synthetic constructs, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of models. Real-world scenarios make the test pragmatic, and synthetic ones leave the space for extending the context length further with ease.

Note:

1. The evaluation code for YaRN-Mistral-7B is implemented by ourselves, and please contact us or submit an issue if there are any problems.
2. Kimi-Chat, Claude 2, and GPT-4 are evaluated using the official API with default configuration.
3. For Math.Calc, the values in the parentheses have a measurement unit of 0.01%. This is because it is easy to get a very low score on this task.
4. The metric for task Math.Find, Math.Calc, Code.Run, Code.Debug, En.Dia, En.MC, Retrieve.KV, Retrieve.Number, and Retrieve.PassKey is accuracy; 

   The metric for task Zh.QA and En.QA are ROUGE F1 score; 
   
   The metric for En.Sum is the `rougeLsum` score from the ðŸ¤— Evaluate library.

## Installation

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

Download the dataset the `data` folder (or set the `--data_dir` argument to the location of the dataset). The data folder structure should be as follows.

```
InfiniteBench
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code_debug.jsonl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code_run.jsonl

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ longbook_choice_eng.jsonl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ longbook_qa_chn.jsonl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ longbook_qa_eng.jsonl
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ longbook_sum_eng.jsonl

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ passkey.jsonl
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ construct_synthetic_dataset.py
...
```

Then, in the `src` folder, execute:

    abstract = "Processing and reasoning over long contexts is crucial for many practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as document comprehension and agent construction. Despite recent strides in making LLMs process contexts with more than 100K tokens, there is currently a lack of a standardized benchmark to evaluate this long-context capability. Existing public benchmarks typically focus on contexts around 10K tokens, limiting the assessment and comparison of LLMs in processing longer contexts. In this paper, we propose , the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains in English and Chinese. The tasks in are designed to require an understanding of long dependencies in contexts and make simply retrieving a limited number of passages from contexts not sufficient for these tasks. Based on , we evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs tailored for processing long contexts. The experimental results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to process 100K+ contexts effectively. Furthermore, we present three intriguing analyses regarding the behavior of LLMs processing long context. Our code and data is released.",
